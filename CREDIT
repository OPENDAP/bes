The calculation of latitude and longitude uses the GCTP library that is distributed by the HDF-EOS5 library. Some functions that calcuate the latitude and longitude are modified based on the HDF-EOS5 library source release. The HDF-EOS5 library can be obtained from http://newsroom.gsfc.nasa.gov/sdptoolkit/toolkit.html

The following lines are from HDF-EOS5 library source release doc/README, which require any use of the HDF-EOS5 to include.
