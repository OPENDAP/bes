# modules to load, includes data modules and command modules            #
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Notes: 
# 1. When the handlers are built, the handler's 'make' builds the
# handler executable for Server3 and the shared object module for
# Hyrax. The Hyrax shared object modules are installed (using 'make
# install') in<prefix>/lib/bes. Make sure you point to the Hyrax
# modules and not the Server3 'handlers'. The Hyrax modules all have
# '_module' in their names.
# 2. The commands that the BES responds to are also provided by modules,
# so make sure that those are loaded in as well. Two modules are
# required for use with Hyrax, the dap and cmd modules.
# 3. If you want ascii, info, and html responses provided by the bes, just
# as in the Server3 handlers, then include the ascii, usage, and www
# modules.
# 4. Order matters. Include the dap, cmd, ascii, usage, www first before
# including handler modules like nc, hdf4, ff.
# 
# Here's an example of the configuration for three handlers (Netcdf,
# hdf4 and FreeForm) and the DAP basic and command modules:
#
# BES.modules=dap,cmd,ascii,usage,www,nc,h4,ff
# BES.module.dap=@modulesdir@/libdap_module.so

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Setting the data location
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#
 
# There are two ways the BES can be used. It can serve as a standalone
# data server or it can work with the OLFS (i.e., as one component of
# the OPeNDAP 4 Data Server). How you point to data differs for each of
# the two cases. If you are using the BES as part of the OPeNDAP 4 Data
# Server, then set 'BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory' to point to the 
# root directory that contains the data you want to serve. In this case
# the value of the 'BES.Data.RootDirectory' parameter doesn't matter, so
# long as it has some value.
#
# If you intend to use the BES as a standalone server, set the value of
# 'BES.Data.RootDirectory' to point to your data and disregard the 
# 'BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory' parameter.
#
# The default value of RootDirectory works with the sample data we include
# with various format handlers distributed for use with the BES. You'll need
# to change this to point to your data! At this time the BES does not support
# multiple RootDirectory values. 3/5/07 jhrg

BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory=@abs_top_srcdir@
BES.Data.RootDirectory=/dev/null

# The TypeMatch parameter is a list of handler/module names and a regular
# expression separated by a colon. If the regular expression matches an item,
# then the BES uses the associated handler/module. Each <handler>:<regular
# expression> pair is followed by a semicolon. This is used when creating
# containers in the BES (the 'set container' command). The example regular
# expression says to use the 'h4' handler for any file with an extension of
# 'hdf', 'HDF' or 'eos' which may also end in '.gz' or '.bz2'. In the latter
# case the file will be treated as a compressed file.

# BES.Catalog.catalog.TypeMatch=nc:.*\.(nc|NC)(\.gz|\.bz2|\.Z)?$;h4.*\.(hdf|HDF|eos)(\.gz|\.bz2|\.Z)?$;

BES.Catalog.catalog.TypeMatch=h4:.*\.(hdf|HDF|eos)(\.bz2|\.gz|\.Z)?$;

# Normally, when a client asks for a data catalog, all files and directories
# are shown. Use the following two parameters to customize this behavior.
# Each parameter is a list of regular expressions, each followed by a
# semicolon (last one must also end with a semicolon as in the example
# below.) First, the Include parameter is applied to the node, and
# then the Exclude parameter is applied. All collections of nodes are shown.
# In the default values below, all nodes with the file extension .nc
# are included (the Include parameter) except those that begin with a dot
# (the Exclud parameter).

BES.Catalog.catalog.Include=;
BES.Catalog.catalog.Exclude=^\..*;

# Is the BES allowed to follow symbolic links when requesting catalog
# information. The default is to not allow the BES to follow symbolic links.
# The values can be either No or Yes. If set to No, and the user requests
# catalog information on a symbolic link then an error is reported and if a
# symbolic link is contained within a collection, it is not included in the
# response. If set to Yes then the requested node in the catalog is treated
# like any other node.
#
# BES.FollowSymLinks parameter is for non-catalog containers and is used in
# conjunction with the BES.RootDirectory above. It is NOT a general setting.
# BES.Catalog.catalog.FollowSymLinks is for catalog requests and data
# containers in the catalog and is used in conjunction with the

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Currently the bz2 and gz file compression methods are understood by the
# BES. We will add support for Z (Unix compress) if there's demand for it.

# All of the following five parameters must be set in this file.

# BES.CacheDir: Where should the result of decompressing a file be stored?
# We've set the value to '/tmp' but you might want to change that to
# /tmp/bes, /var/cache/bes, et c., depending on the server-host's
# organization.

# BES.CachePrefix: Prefix for the name of the file used to store the result
# of decompression.

# BES.CacheSize: Size of the cache in megabytes. When the size of the cached
# files exceeds this value, the cache will be purged using a
# last-accessed-first-removed approach. Because it's usually impossible to
# determine the sizes of data files before decompressing them, there may be
# times when the cache holds more data than this value. Ideally this value
# should be several times the size of the largest file you plan to serve. 

# BES.Uncompress.Retry: When waiting for the cache lock, how long should the
# BES wait before trying to get the lock again if previous attempts have
# failed? 

# BES.Uncompress.NumTries: How many times should the BES try to acquire the
# lock before it signals an error?

# The BES cache directory is locked to prevent the different beslistener
# processes from simultaneously removing files and leaving the cache in an
# inconsistent state. Use the Retry and NumTries parameters to tune this
# behavior. Generally, NumTries should be set to about 10. The units of Retry
# are microseconds. To tune the NumTries and Retry, use the formula Retry =
# (0.2s/Average_file_sizeMB)/NumTries. So if your average file size is 10MB
# and you've settled on a NumTries of 10, (0.2s/10MB)/10 = 0.002s or 2000
# microseconds. If you have really large files (e.g., decompressed they are
# 500MB), try setting NumTries to 100.

# HDF4 handler specific parameters
# CacheDir: Cache directory used by the HDF4 data handler.
# Suggestion: Consider making this '/tmp/bes'; see the comment at
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#
# EnableCF: Handle HDF data to follow the CF conventions
#          (true,yes|false,no, defaults to true)
# Since most centers  would like to handle HDF4 data that follows CF now,
# EnableCF is set to be true, KY 2012-6-5
#
#   If this key's value is false, the handler will behave same as the default 
#  handler. The output will not follow basic CF conventions and most of NASA 
# products cannot be visualized by netCDF visualization tools such as IDV and 
# Panoply. The rest of keys below relies on this option and it must be set
# to be "true" to have effects on the handler's output. Thus, this is the most 
# important key to turn it on first.
H4.EnableCF=true

H4.EnablePassFileID=false


# When turning on this key, the handler will handle AIRS level 3 version 6 products
# and MOD08_M3-like products in a speedy way by taking advantage of the special data
# structures in these two products. Using this key requires the use of HDF-EOS2 lib.
# now although HDF-EOS2 lib. will not be called. By turning on this key, potentially
# HDF-EOS2 files that provide dimension scales for all dimensions may also be handled
# quickly. By default, this key should be set to true.
H4.EnableSpecialEOS=true

# DisableScaleOffsetComp: Disable Scale and offset computation  
#
# Some NASA HDF4(MODIS etc.) products don't follow the CF rule to pack the data.
# To avoid the confusion for OPeNDAP's clients , the handler may adopt the following two approaches:

# 1) Apply the scale and offset computation to the individual data point if the scale 
#    and offset rule doesn't follow CF in the handler.
#
# 2) If possible, transform the scale and offset rule to CF rule.
#
# Since approach 1 may degrade the performance of fetching large size data by heavy computation,
# we recommend approach 2, which is indicated by setting this key to be true.   
# By default, this key should always be true.  
H4.DisableScaleOffsetComp=true

# By turning on this key, the handler will check if the datatype of scale_factor and offset is the same.
# This is required by CF.
# if they don't share the same datatype, the handler will make the data type of offset be the same as that of scale_factor.
#Since we haven't found the data type inconsistencies of scale_factor and offset, in order not affect the 
# performance, this key will be set to false by default. 
H4.EnableCheckScaleOffsetType = false

# Disable StructMetadata 
H4.DisableStructMetaAttr=true

# This key is for MODIS swath that uses the dimension map.
# If this key is set to be true, the handler will search the directory where the data files reside and see
# if corresponding MODIS geolocation files(MOD03 or MYD03) can be found, if yes, the handler will use 
# the corresponding MODIS geolocation files for latitude and longitude.
H4.EnableCheckMODISGeoFile=false

#   If this key's value is false, additional Vdata such as "Level 1B Swath 
#  Metadta" in LAADS MYD021KM product will not be processed and visible 
#  in the DAS/DDS output. Those additional Vdatas are added directly using 
#  HDF4 APIs and HDF-EOS2 APIs cannot access them.
H4.EnableHybridVdata=true

# Some CERES products(CER_AVG,CER_ES4,CER_SRB and CER_ZAVG, see description
# in the HDFSP.h) have  many SDS fields and some Vdata fields. Correspondingly,
# the DDS and DAS page may be very long. The performance of accessing such
# products with visualization clients may be greatly affected. 
# It may potentially  even choke netCDF java clients.
# To avoid such cases, we will not map vdata to DAP in such products by default.
# Users can turn on this key to check vdata information of some CERES products.
# This key will not affect the access of other products.
H4.EnableCERESVdata=false

#   If this key's value is false, small Vdata datasets will be mapped to 
# arrays in DDS output instead of attributes in DAS. 
#   If this key's value is true, Vdata is mapped to attribute if there are less than 
# or equal to 10 records.
H4.EnableVdata_to_Attr=true

#   If this key's value is false, the short dataset name becomes long name with
# Vgroup prefixed and fullpath attribute will not be printed in DAS output.
#   For example, the DAS output for Region_Number dataset
#
#      Region_Number {
#          String coordinates "Colatitude Longitude";
#          String fullpath "/Monthly Hourly Averages/Time And Position/Region Nu\
# mber";
#     }
#
# becomes
#    
#     Monthly_Hourly_Averages_Time_And_Position_Region_Number {
#          String coordinates "Monthly_Hourly_Averages_Time_And_Position_Colatit\
# ude Monthly_Hourly_Averages_Time_And_Position_Longitude";
#     }
#
# in CER_AVG_Aqua-FM3-MODIS_Edition2B_007005.200510.hdf.
H4.EnableCERESMERRAShortName=true

#   If this key's value is false, handler will check if there's any Vdata that 
#  has the same name as SDS. We haven't found such case in NASA products so it's 
# safe to disable this to improve performance.
H4.DisableVdataNameclashingCheck=true

#   If this key's value is true, handler will generate Vdata's attributes. By 
#     default, it's turned off because most NASA hybrid products do not seem to store
#  important information in Vdata attributes. If you serve pure HDF4 files, it's 
#     recommended to turn this value to true so that users can see all data. This
#  key will not affect the behavior of the handler triggered by the 
#     H4.EnableVdata_to_Attr key in section 3.3 except the Vdata attributes of
#  small Vdatas that are mapped to DAS instead of DDS. They will be also turned
#     off from the DAS output.
#  If Vdata doesn't have any attribute or field attribute, the description

#         String hdf4_vd_desc "This is an HDF4 Vdata.";

#  will not appear in the attribute for that Vdata although the key is true.
#     The attribute container of the Vdata will always appear regardless of this key.
