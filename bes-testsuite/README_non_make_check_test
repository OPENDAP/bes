Currently there are a few tests that the normal "make check" doesn't cover. Depending on one's need, they can be easily tested manually. Eventually if it is necessary, a kind of automatic tests should be implemented.

1. mv hdf5_handlerTest.at hdf5_handlerTest.at.orig

2. CF DMR from DDS and DAS option test with fake data
We still keep an option to generate the DMR from DDS and DAS when H5.EnableCF=true. 
To test this option, under the current directory(bes-testsuite),
cp hdf5_handlerTest.dap2dmr.at hdf5_handlerTest.at
cd ..
make check
You should see "all tests get passed".

3. Tests with NASA tests
1) Obtain NASA data
cd data.nasa
./download.sh
./download_dap4.sh
cd ../data
ln -s ../data.nasa .

1) CF DMR from DDS and DAS option test with NASA data
cd ../bes-testsuite
cp hdf5_handlerTest.nasa.at hdf5_handlerTest.at
cd ..
make check
You should see "all tests get passed"

2) CF DMR option test with NASA data
(1) DAS and DDS generation with CFDMR key on/missing  
cd bes-testsuite
cp hdf5_handlerTest.cfdmr.at hdf5_handlerTest.at
cd ..
make check
You should see "all tests get passed"

(2) DMR generation with CFDMR key on/missing
cd bes-testsuite
cp hdf5_handlerTest.cfdmr_only.at hdf5_handlerTest.at
cd ..
make check
You should see "all tests get passed"

3) Non-CF option test with NASA data
This test is for when the EnableCF=false
cd bes-testsuite
cp hdf5_handlerTest.default.dap4.at hdf5_handlerTest.at
cd ..
make check
You should see "all tests get passed"

Note:The tests for NASA data may take some time.

4. Valgrind tests

1) Quick test
cd bes-testsuite
cp hdf5_handlerTest.valgrind.at hdf5_handlerTest.at
cd ..
make check
pushd /tmp
grep "definitely lost: " h5.valgrind.log
You should only see ""definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks"
pushd 

2) Comprehensive test
./test.valgrind.sh >&tt.out&
If everything is right, you should see "OK" in the output.
This test includes the valgrind memory check for all the
fake and NASA tests.

Note: the comprehensive test takes much longer time.

At the end of all the tests, 
cd bes-testsuite
mv hdf5_handlerTest.at.orig hdf5_handlerTest.at
