2006-07-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated configure.ac so that the build looks for the BES in places
	other than the default prefix (i.e., it now uses bes-config).

	Updated the version number in configure.ac and the spec file; updated
	ChangeLog, NEWS, README and INSTALL.

2006-07-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added bes.m4 to conf.

2006-07-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed the subdir 'hdf4_handler;' I think this was added by mistake
	during one of the tagging operations.

2006-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	dap_cmdmodule library renamed to dap_cmd_module so that all loaded
	module libraries are named <something>_module

2006-06-30  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	In the help response added begin and end tags called handler to
	separate the different hander help responses and added a tag
	called name within the handler tag to say which handler this help
	is for, changed the name of the handler to hdf4 so there isn't a
	conflict with the hdf5 handler, deleted the extra file
	HDFRequestHandler and hdf_module.cc

2006-06-29  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	bin program depends on shared library, not static library:

2006-06-28  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	supports returning DDX responses.

2006-03-16  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added include of unistd.h to hdf_handler.cc. This is for the
	unlink function.

2006-03-16  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Version 3.6.1

2006-03-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added code to hdfdesc.cc and hdf_handler.cc so that if the
	cache dir is not given or not usable, the handler now defaults
	to not caching the files (as opposed to throwing an exception).
	Also added a virtual destructor to ReadTagRef.h.

2006-03-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added code to hdfdesc.cc and hdf_handler.cc so that if the
	cache dir is not given or not usable, the handler now defaults
	to not caching the files (as opposed to throwing an exception).
	Also added a virtual destructor to ReadTagRef.h.

2006-03-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated for release 3.6.0-3.

2006-03-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the release number to three.

2006-03-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the release number to three.

2006-03-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Bumped up the release number since I applied a patch from Patrice
	Dumas (Fixed a gcc 4.1 compilation problem in htstream.h and
	HDFGrid.h).

2006-03-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Applied a patch from Partice Dumas that fixes two compile problems
	that are flagged by gcc 4.1. In hdfclass/htstream.h and HDFGrid.h
	some methods were qualified with the class name even though they
	were inside a class declaration.

2006-02-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated version numbers.

2006-02-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	conf/hdf4.m4.

2006-02-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	hdf4_handler.spec: add libdap-devel as a BuildRequires. From a
	patch by Patrice Dumas

2006-02-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	updated

2006-02-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	configure.ac: now requires libdap 3.6.0

2006-02-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I removed two includes from hdf_module.cc since they no longer
	appear in the BES software.

2006-02-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified the hdfeos parser (hdfeos.y, ...) so that the aliases
	work with the changes in libdap. In the end, I modified libdap and
	wound up using mostly unchanged code here, but I did add a
	function (unused as of now) that might come in handly later on
	when we use only the DDX in the servers.

2006-01-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified hdf_handler.cc, eosdas-test.cc and hdfdesc.cc so that
	they no longer call any of the libdap iostreams methods (which
	have been removed from libdap).

2006-01-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed set_mime-test() in hdf_handler.cc so that it uses stdout
	and not cout. I removed the iostreams versions of the
	set_mime...() function from libdap in version 3.6.

2005-11-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved to the correct place this time!

2005-11-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2004-01-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* I moved the release-3-4 tag to a branch (because at least some
	of the files had this as a regular tag) and then tagged everything
	here as release-3-4FCS. This was to fix the problem with
	release-3-4 not being a branch! I have no idea what affect this
	will have on the merging process.

2003-01-30    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* I merged with the code marked release-3-2-4, which was the last
	tag I could find. Weird, given the entry here made on 2002-05-01.
	The code fails eight tests, all have something to do with
	Sequences. the code from the 3.2 branch exhibits the same behavior
	when linked with the trunk DAP, but works fine with the 3.2 dap.
	However, the changes between the 3.2 and trunk dap seem very
	minor... 

2002-06-03    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* HDFSequence.cc: Removed call to Sequence::set_level().

2002-05-01    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-6.

2002-04-11    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed casts littered throughout the code. Files: HDFArray.cc,
	HDFFloat32.cc, HDFFloat32.h, HDFGrid.cc, HDFInt16.cc, HDFInt16.h,
	HDFSequence.cc, HDFStructure.cc, HDFUInt16.cc, HDFUInt16.h,
	dodsutil.h, funcs.cc, hdfdesc.cc.

	* dodsutil.cc: Not used; removed. 

	* hc2dap.cc: Removed HDFTypeName functions.

	* funcs.cc: Replaced BaseType::type_name() with BaseType::type()
	* dodsutil.cc: Ibid.

	* Massive changes to the code (checked in on 4/9/2002 and
	4/10/2002). Changed HDFArray, HDFStructure, HDFSequence and
	HDFGrid so that all of the DODS numeric types are used when
	spitting out variables from HDF files. Also changes hc2dap.cc so
	that calls to ExportDataForDODS are no longer made.

2002-01-29  Dan Holloway <d.holloway@gso.uri.edu>

	* Added new elements in the hdf_vgroup structure
	to maintain the string-representation of the variable
	associated with each vgroup tag/ref in the hdf datafile.
	This is required to support modifications to the Ancillary
	DDS to limit the number of variables accessible (Modis M3)
	to a more manageable number.   Previously, the Ancillary
	DDS was assumed to be a simple cache of the actual DDS
	from the hdf datafile, no modifications were possible.  The
	new behavior allows removing variables only, you cannot
	move vgroup variables among containers, though that is
	certainly possible just not supported.

	* Fixes in hdfclass/hcstream.h,hdfclass.h,vgroup.cc
	* Fixes in hc2dap.cc/LoadStructureFromVgroup
	
2001-10-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-4.

	* Minor fixes for configure.

	* Updated README and INSTALL.

2001-09-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-3. The next merge should use
	release-3-2-3 -j release-3-2.

2001-09-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Minor build fixes.

2001-08-29  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* I removed some old files in src (dattr.cc, escfilt.cc, ...) that
	were no longer used. I also updated Makefile.in's list of
	dependencies. This should fix a nagging problem (bug 246) where
	the HDF server would not build on Solaris because make there
	wanted to compile dattr.cc (which no longer builds).

2001-08-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-2. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-2 -j release-3-2.

2001-08-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a bug in the hdf-eos lex scanner (Ethan).

	* Changed to the new way DODSFilter handles version requests.

	* Modified basename() so it would remove the garbage from the
	beginning of the names of decompressed files.

	* Removed the code which escapes names. This function is now
	handled for all the servers by the dap.

2001-06-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2 head (tagged release-3-2-1). The next
	merge should use -j release-3-2-1 -j release-3-2.

	* Many bugs fixed; should build with hdf 4.1r4.

	* HDFStructure.cc: Initial error flag variable to zero in read
	method, int err=0; The read_tagref method for this datatype does
	not modify the value of err for successful reads, on Linux systems
	this variable was initially non-zero. (From Dan)

	* Fixed a error in the --with-test-url switch. The identifier
	test-url was misspelled as `testurl'. Changed the default test url
	to point to `test' on the localhost.

	* Moved the CVS Log entries to the end of each file.
	Added code to catch Error objects thrown by the dap library.
	Changed the read() method's definition to match the dap library.

	* Changed to the new way DODSFilter handles version requests.

	* Removed nph-hdf in favor of nph-dods.

	* Removed TK_LIBS references, not used and references to that in
	the makefile that (that were unresolved during configure) were
	causing problems. I see no reason for references to TK_LIBS on the
	server side.

	* added note about perl modules, rewrote much text, reformatted.
	(From Tom).

2000-03-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merge: cvs update -j release-3-1-3 -j release-3-1, the next
	merge should use -j release-3-1-4 -j release-3-1

2000-03-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed the error message sent when HDF-EOS attributes are hosed.
	Now the message is embedded in the DAS object. That way the client
	gets most of the attributes back and an error message without DODS
	devising some scheme for returning both Error and DAS objects.

	* The HDF-EOS attribute scanner now ignores semicolons. Apparently
	some HDF-EOS files use semicolons to end each line in the HDF-EOS
	attribute section; this was confusing clients since the semicolons
	wound up in the output.

	* dodsutil.cc: Removed duplicates of the functions in the dap file
	escaping.cc. These were old and not getting fixed up; I'd rather
	just work on one copy of the escaping functions!

	* HDFArray.cc, etc.: Switched to the id2dods, etc. escaping
	function in the dap. This should banish the last of the string
	indexing bugs.

	* Added eosdas-test program. This can be used to test the HDF-EOS
	attribute parser.

2000-03-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merge: cvs update -j release-3-1-2 -j release-3-1, the next
	merge should use -j release-3-1-3 -j release-3-1
	
2000-03-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a bug where bad index variables were used with the
	string::find() functions. Using int, uint32, ..., variables to
	hold the indices breaks on some 64bit machines. The fixed code
	runs OK on Sol 7 (64bit) but the problem did not show up there.
	The problems shows up on alphas. I'm committing these changes and
	they'll be tested on the alpha.

	* configure now uses the new DODS_PROG_PERL test and nph-hdf.in
	uses that value for Perl. This eliminates the old exec perl hack
	which broke on Linux.

	* Fixes for the binary-tar target.

1999-11-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merge: cvs update -j release-3-1, the next merge should use -j
	release-3-1-2 -j release-3-1
	
1999-11-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixes to simplify building.

1999-05-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merge with alpha-3-0-0

1999-05-25  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Security fixes added to nph-hdf.in.

1999-05-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added test-coverage target to Makefile.in

1999-03-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added stubs for the new datatypes.

1999-01-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* The server now registers the file name properly. This ensures
	that the new projection functions can call the read() member
	function and not fail.

1998-11-11  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added Jake Hambey's tests.

1998-09-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Many changes includig support for vdata.

Tue Dec 30 15:59:46 1997  James Gallagher  <jimg@localhost>

	* Changed the filter programs so that they use the new DODSFilter
	class. This corrects problems with those program and the
	DODS_Dispatch perl class.
