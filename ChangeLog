	Changed the sys admin email to not use angle brackets so if a user
	doesn't change it it doesn't mess up any xml responses. Did the same

	BESPlugin.h: Changed RTLD_GLOBAL to RTLD_LOCAL in th dlopen() call.
	This should prevent symbol clashes between two modules. That is, the

	The transmitter was not being set early enough in the process of
	handling a request. if an exception was thrown then it was possible
	to not have a transmitter set. It's still possible, if an exception
	is thrown during startup, but setting the transmitter to either
	basic or http is being done much sooner. During the build phase it
	is possible to replace the transmitter with one set in the request,
	such as using a 'return as' command in a get.

	The uncompress script now purges the cache directory using a cache
	max size that is passed in. I am using the purge_cache perl routine
	from DODS_Cache.pm in dap-server, with some modifications. The
	configure now looks for gzip, bzip2, and perl and sets them
	correctly in the two scripts bes-uncompress.sh and bes-purge.pl.
	Create .in files to do this and modified the Makefile.am in dispatch
	to generate the two scripts. Modified BESContainer to look for the
	key in bes.conf BES.CacheDir.MaxSize, which defaults to 500 MB, and
	pass that cache size to the uncompress script.

	use the name as specified in the bes configuration file instead of a
	hard-coded name. Changed adding the catalog to first look to see if
	a catalog with the given name has already been added. if it has,
	then the new one is not added and false is returned.  Also added

	Default uncompression script for uncompressing compressed data files
	using gzip and bzip2

2006-08-19  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Added ability to uncompress compressed data files by using the
	access method on the BESContainer class, rather than simply calling
	get_real_name, which is what was being called. Call get_real_name to
	simply get the real name of the file, but use access when ready to
	access the file for reading. Added three parameters to the
	configuraiton file. BES.CacheDir specifies where the uncompressed
	files will be stored, default /tmp. BES.Compressed.Extensions is a
	regular expression of the different compressed file types.
	BES.Compressed.Script is the shell command to use to uncompress the
	files, not just gzip or bzip2, but a script that can determine what
	to use to uncompress the files, determine the name of the cached
	file that will be created, uncompress the data file, and echo to
	stdout what the cached file name is.

	The TypeMatch parameter is only used when creating containers where

2006-06-30  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	If a libdap Error exception is caught, instead of throw a plain
	BESException, which will eventually force the server to exit, throw a
	BESHandlerException instead which will not force an exit. The
	BESHandlerException simply reports a problem in the data handler.

2006-06-30  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	When an exception is caught and the response is built with the
	exception in BESExceptionManager, the response is still for the
	request, even though an exception was thrown. The response then
	needs to be named the same as if the request was successful and no
	exception was thrown. It was being named BESException, but that's
	not the name of the response. The response needs to be named, for
	example, showInfo or setContainer.

	UnixSocket.cc: I removed so debug code, added some comments and
	cleaned up my fix for the socket bind bug that showed up on OS/X.
	I also changed the call to strcpy to strncpy since the size of the
	string is 104 char.

2006-05-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	UnixSocket.cc: Fix for the fix; Looks like the original way of
	passing the size of the sockaddr structure was right but missing a
	'+1.'

2006-05-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	UnixSocket.cc: Fixed the calls to bind. Each call passed a bad
	value for the size of the sockaddr struct. On OS/X this caused the
	name of the socket to be truncated and the code could not remove

2005-08-23  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Using App class for Handler

2005-08-22  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	in interactive mode all commands, client and server, must end with
	a semicolon. Let the user know.

2005-08-22  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	when setting output to a file in client command, open to append to
	the file, not truncate

2005-08-22  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	added client commands to supress output, send output to screen, or
	send output to file

2005-08-22  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	removed http transmitter from dods_module to http_transmitter
	module that must be linked in if the server wants http
	transmission. Removed different PERSISTENCE_INIT macros and
	replaced with one. Added TRANSMITTER_INIT macro

2005-08-22  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	local dependencies on dispatch, ppt and command directories, not
	installed versions

2005-08-19  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	if string not found in find method then string::npos returned, not
	< 0

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	changed template dir and added checks at beginning

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	script and templates to allow someone to build an opendap-g data
	handler

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	adding back

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	need to replace somehow

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	no need to check for the c compiler, only the C++ compiler

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Using new PPT library using sockets and encapsulating the PPT
	calls. This way we can switch in and out different communication
	protocols without changing this code.

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	No longer needing this code

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Completely re-worked PPT to keep it more moduler, more black box,
	so that external code need not know about how to communicate using
	PPT, but the underlying client and server connection code knows
	how to initiate a connection, terminate a connection, transmit
	data with a terminate string, etc...

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Using the new PPT library, much more moduler

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	OPeNDAP Apache module that uses command line interface to parse a
	URL request.

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Implemented command line command syntax in separate library, not
	part of dispatch, so now can implement SOAP interface, or some
	other interface to OPeNDAP-g

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Removed parse methods from response handler making the command
	syntax a separate library in a separate directory, the command
	directory. Removed GetResponseHandler and ShowResponseHandler
	because these weren't really response handlers but just classes to
	parse the commands, which have been moved to OPeNDAPGetCommand and
	OPeNDAPShowCommand in the command directory. Removed most
	variables from DODSDataHandlerInterface and replaced them with a
	map of string-string pairs representing those variables. Each
	request will have a different set of variables needed to execute
	that request. Moved DODSApache and DODSWrapper to an apache
	directory. Also moved DODSParser to the command directory and
	called it OPeNDAPCmdParser. Also changed the aggregation server to
	be like the return mechanism. The aggregation command was changed
	to say "aggregate using <name> by <command>". So now the
	aggregation method looks up the aggregation handler with the given
	name and executes the command against the handler.

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	changed to have keys file passed in to the constructor instead of
	specifying dods ini file

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

2005-08-08  root

	Auto reset of Subversion properties

2005-08-01  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	changed aggregation command to be aggregate using <agg_handler> by
	<agg_command>, agg_command wrapped in quotes still

2005-07-13  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	If Verbose key in initialization file was set to no then
	DODSMemoryGlobalArea suspended logging to TheDODSLog but never
	turned it back on, so non-verbose logging also didn't get logged.
	Called the resume method on TheDODSLog to turn logging back on.
	Might want to think about using the general verbose flag for this.

2005-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	moved dods.ini to opendap.ini. Default prefix is $OPENDAP_ROOT, not
	installing headers.

2005-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	default prefix is $OPENDAP_ROOT and header install directory is
	include/opendap-g.

	include/opendap-g.

2005-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	New documentation. Now have wrapper holding on to encoded url
	string so can ask wrapper for different keyword/value pairs in the
	url, such as username and request.

2005-07-05  Rob Morris <Robert.O.Morris@jpl.nasa.gov>

	Set eol-style to native on all text file in the trunk
