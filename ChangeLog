	Cache fix

	Clean up residual cache code. Add a note about fcntl(2) versus flock(2)
	Both fcntl(2) and flock(2) can be used for advisory locking. The
	BESFileLockingCache uses fcntl() and that impacts testing since
	all of our testing is single-process. Not a huge deal, but if we
	want more complete testing we'll need to change how we implement
	the locks or use multi-process testing.

	Modest fixes to the test code in cacheT

2017-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix to BESFSDir for the opendir/readdir race condition.
	When two processes are using the same directory and one process makes
	and deletes files in the directory at the same time as the other
	process uses opendir/readdir to iterate over the files in the
	directory, it's possible for file names to show up in entries returned
	by readdir that no longer exist (i.e., stat(2) returns -1). It's better
	to ignore this than signal an error (IMHO).

	understanding of the BES File and Dir classes...

2017-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Unit tests in dispatch fail when run in parallel. This is a fix.
	The setup() code in pvolT seems to conflict with the code in keysT
	when keysT starts and then pvolT starts and finishes before keysT
	finishes. I have no idea why, but the text in the pvolT's setup()
	shows up in keysT. It turns out that the setup() code is not needed,
	and removing it seems to fix the problem. Seems to...

	Repairs for netcdf and hdf5 builds
	The hdf5 library now uses libdl and that has to be used when
	calling autoconf's CHECK_LIB (for both netcdf4 and HDF5). This
	broke the HDF5 handker (and the netcdf handler on CentOS 7).

2016-06-08  Cloud User  <centos@ip-172-31-39-143.ec2.internal>

	HDF5 needs libdl and so netcdf4 also needs libdl
	The configure script was not finding netcdf on CentOS 7. I think this
	will be an issue elsewhere but it has not shown up because not all of
	the deps code has been updated to the newer HDF5 library.

	Modified function promoter to work on any struct that ends with the string '_unwrap'

2015-11-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hacked BESDapResponseBuilder.cc so functions returning structures work
	A test hack: If we see that a server function has returned a Structure,
	assume that it should be 'flattened' and do so. This means that the
	ugrid() subsetting function can return its multiple variables and the
	client will see that as such and not a Structure with N fields. This
	preserves the look of the source dataset. We'll have to think about
	this hack and how best to really implement it. The code could be faster
	(using fewer/no copies) and could be less prone to failure (it assumes
	every Structure returned by a function should be flattened). Not
	insurmountable problems...

2015-10-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	NCML module update

	Refactor for BESKeys and TheBESKeys: Added a virtual dtor
	I also changed how BESKeys *TheBESKeys::TheKeys() was written so
	that the static class variable TheBESKeys::ConfigFile is set
	when a bes.conf file is found in one of the etc dirs.

	Updates to hd4 and ncml handlers
	ncml: Fixed the evil HR-64 bug
	hdf4: Removed an old unused file

	Changes made while working on HR-64
	I made some minor changes to the BES while tracking down HR-64.
	The actual fix was in ncml_module, but these changes fixed
	formatting and BESDEBUG output.

	Fixed a glitch in volatile container store
	When a real name is passed in and does not contain a leading
	slash (/), don't add it. This change may not matter much in the
	grand scheme of things, but it fixes a failed unit test (pvolT).

	Bind using IP

2015-10-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	New feature: Use BES.ServerIP to specify an IP on which to listen
	This was requested by mmceniry@itsc.uah.edu (see https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HR-47).
	If not given, the server reverts to its old behavior of listening
	on the default address. Some of the files' edits are simply reformatting.
	In those cases where most of the file was reformatted and I also
	made a functional change, I put my initials and the date in a comment.

	I removed the calls to the SSL checks; the code does not use SSL

	I moved the unused SSL files in bes/ppt to nes/ppt/old
	I spent an hour modifying these only to realize they are never used!

	Small changes - hunting function test issues.

	Small changes for clarity

	Adding dispatch/BESUncompressCache class to replace BESCache3

	Updated use of BESFileLockingCache in numerous places to

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of
	changing ubiquitous use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and
	BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression
	cache (which is what it actually is) so as to avoid cache
	configuration collisions with various handlers that also were
	utilizing the same cache with different expectations. Now, by
	calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir,
	BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we
	specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration
	from the other caches.

2015-09-30  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Initial cache control patch (version 2), in which we use the
	cache_prefix value to form the name of the cache control file.

2015-09-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed old code; still not sure why xmlCleanupParser makes
	the daemon command processor fail. Removed it; left a comment.

	Calling xmlCleanupParser() in DaemonCommadnHandler is an error
	It results in a double free.

	Added calls to xmlCleanupParser()
	To xmlcommand/BESXMLInterface.cc when an exception is thrown and
	server/DaemonCommandHandler.cc in both the normal and exceptional
	cases.

	Fix for the obscure 'XML element order depended on BESDEBUG'
	The problem was a missing call to xmlCleanupParser in
	BESXMLInterface::build_data_request_plan().

	XML element order dependent on BESDEBUG use.
	The culprit was a missing call to xmlCleanupParser() in

	Fixed version_update_modules.sh so that it does not mangle Makefile.am
	Before it was incorrectly substituting the version number.

	Added *.Po to gitignore

	Eliminate linking with .so modules
	Some of the unit tests were linking with the .so modules, which is
	not portable. This might be causing errors in the unit tests. At the
	very least it was sloppy. Also modified the Makefiles so that bes.conf
	files are removed by the clean target.

2015-09-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix configure_modules.ac for CentOS6
	The .ac file used 'if test "$libgf_ok"="no" but that
	doesn't work. there must be spaces between the '=' and
	its arguments. Also, the double quotes are not needed.
	Lastly, the AX_COMAPRE_VERSION macro can be replaced
	by AS_COMPARE_VERSION, but the conf/ax_compare_version.m4
	file must remain, maybe because it's needed by other AX
	macros...

	Force a rebuild of the cached libdap 3.15
	This should fix a bug in the FreeForm handler - the new libdap on both
	master and parallel_io has the fix.

	Compile, test and deploy BES using standard configuration
	Attempting to build a standard configuration of the BES using just the
	modules that I need and without all of the dependencies that I don't
	need. So using the configure_standard.ac configuration file.
	The besd.in file which builds the besd initialization script that goes
	into /etc/init.d was not setting up the prefix variables correctly so
	the bes was not launching using that script.
	configure_standard.ac seemed to have not been updated with the other
	configuration file as it appears to be working.
	dapreader Makefile.am was missing the inclusion of the dap server libs
	to resolve the Ancillary methods used, specificall reading a das
	ancillary file.

	...so that it will build libdap 3.15

	The aggregation_improvements branch.
	Requires the parallel_io branch version of libdap and uses the
	pipelining branch version of ncml_module. This version also will
	rebuild the bes deps built using the install_bes_source_deps

	tests in dapreader fail
	Add -k to make check to see all the tests that fail and if the missing
	gdal library is a problem with the check target.

	test if make check -j7 work with travis
	Removing libgdal fixed the issue with uuid/uuid.h - apparently one
	failed apt-get lib caused the other to not load as well. Will make check
	work without libgdal?

	removed libgdal from packages loaded by travis.yml
	This may fix the build, or at least address the uuid/uuid.h not
	found problem (uuid/uuid.h) is found by libdap when building on travis.

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes
	Conflicts:

	tweaked heap_profiler and addedsome info about the AIRX aggregation

	Two new aggregations for use with the heap_profiler script
	These use much smaller variables and smaller data sets, so the
	affect is less pronounced, but it's easy to see how much memory
	was allocated for the actual data returned.

	Added a second 'small aggregation'
	This also uses AIRX and builds a much larger response using a larger
	number of variables. It's about four times the memory footprint of
	the first 'small' aggregation.

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:opendap/bes

	Timing run on 7/7/2015

2015-07-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added calls to xmlCleanupParser() and fixed a catch() block in XMLInterface.
	I added calls to xmlCleanupParser() in the terminate() methods
	of ServerApp and StandAloneApp - this elimiates some reported
	leaks from valgrind although they are likely once-per-process
	leaks. Also changed a catch() block in XMLInterface so that
	all excpetions are caught (it is logged and re-thrown); before
	only BESError was caught.

2015-06-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added compile guards for stdlib.h and atexit

	Resource leak in BESCache3 fixed
	This is a minor issue, but the storage for the singleton was being
	leaked and showes upin valgrind leak reports. This fix was to add a
	void () function that deletes the global pointer and is called using
	atexit().

2015-06-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Travis build; hdf5 fix
	Changed the HDF5 library configure so that the HDF5 library is installed
	in /usr/local.

	Fixed timeTest so that it will work for DDX responses.

	*.log --> *.txt: Easier to import to a spreadsheet.

	Reran the AIRX timing tests
	I think the timing was stoped while it ran the first time,
	leading to values that were way too high (by a factor of two).
	[ci skip]

2015-06-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	another hack to the travis.yml file.
	Also a minor edit to the configure.ac file.

	The log is just too big - redirect stdout from the three source builds to /dev/null

	Baselines for the four sample aggregations.

	Removed the hdf5-serial-dev package in favor of a source tar ball.
	This addresses an issue where the debian package using an older
	API than our code. The newer ubuntu dists have packages that
	don't look like they have this problem, but we're stuck at ubuntu 12
	with Travis.

	Added the ncml used to build the aggregations
	... and made minor edits to the README

	Added the 6.19.15 baselines
	These files contain performance data from an early run of these
	tests. There were a number of problems with the handlers/datasets
	that had to be sorted out, but I thought it was important to save
	this data. The raw logs are huge (many files > 500M) so I'll not
	put those in github now (but they are backed up using an AMI
	snapshot).

	Removed the Grid_lat and Grid_lon variables from the GPM aggregations.
	With the changes made by THG, these variables no longer appear
	in the DDS.

2015-06-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved the rest of the DMR commadn files to 'DMR_command' dirs

	Moved the DMR bescmd in TRMM_3B42 to DMR_commands
	...because the dmr response does not work yet.

	Moved the TRM_3A11 dmr tests to DMR_commands
	...so they will not be run. The NcML handler does not build valid
	DMR responses. These are not properly constrained.

2015-06-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	Added 'ddx' to the set of extensions recognized.
	...but we don't actually run ddx tests

	bes cmd files changed
	I found that the 'granule' files were actually accessing all of the
	granules in the aggregation. I edited them so that only one granule
	is accessed.

	Merge branch 'timing_jhrg' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into timing_jhrg
	Fixed conflicts with timeTest.

2015-06-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed tests and install from travis.yml
	...just get the build working for now

	travis.yml: break the build apart to find if make works but the tests fail.

	travis.yml: The libdap dep seems set now... turn on the handlers

	travis.yml: libdap-3.14.0 needs bison
	Actually, configure requires it, but the new tar.gz is built with the
	generated sources, so it's not really needed.

	New approach to the libdap dependency - build it from a tar.gz

2015-06-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into timing_jhrg

	Added -d and -D options to timeTest

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:opendap/bes

	Changed reps and the order of debug options
	Changed debug options from cerr,timing,ncml to cerr,ncml,timing

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes.git into timing_jhrg

	Reorganization of the bescmd files and minor changes to the bash scripts
	...with an eye toward being able to run these independently and making
	the result(s) a little easier to understand.

2015-06-19  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Hack travis.yml: run configure using --without-dap-modules

	Reformat and cleanup the timing/README
	[ci skip]

2015-06-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modify the travis bes build to use make -k -j7
	I need to see all the places the build will fail...

	Changed the libcurl4 package to libcurl4-gnutls-dev
	...since that's what seems to be loaded. I also changed the dep in the
	libdap.deb to that as well.

	debugging the travis.yml
	...there's some issue with libcurl4 and libdap.deb

	More travis/libdap.deb work...

	travis hack Re: libdap deb (--force-overwrite)

	Fixed broken hdf5 dev packge in travis.yml

	Updates to travis.yml
	Now attempts to use apt-get for all the dependencies. Uses a .deb
	package for libdap to avoid building it, as well.

2015-06-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	Added travis.yml
	This (initial) version of travis.yml builds the hyrax-dependencies and
	libdap4 projects too. There might be a better way, to do this, however.

2015-06-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Dropped h4 and h5 debug switches from basic timing

	Adjusted constraint ecpressions in  agg performance test commands to avoid invoking the subset of aggregation var bug

2015-06-10  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Updated READEME

	Added top level timing test driver script

	Added README and organized timing directory

2015-06-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Rmoved aggregation variable 'time'from constraint expression used in grnule file.

2015-06-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	 Tuning timing tests and commands

2015-06-03  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Adding timing tests (bes command files)

	Changes from github

	Small updates to StopWatch implementation.

	Adding timing tests to BES.

2015-06-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESStopWatch changes
	I added to the previous fixes: Fixed up the ctor parameters so
	they used the initialization list, reordered them to match the
	declaration order, removed the static string object, and moved
	the cotrs to the header (still they only contain inits).

2015-06-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'make-mask-alternative'

2015-05-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added modules with new commits

2015-05-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for 'configure can't find gdal' bug

2015-05-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed unused includes; fixed a comment

	Added back second test; removed some dead code

	Reformatted BESDapResponseCache.cc
	It has a bug, but this just fixes teh formatting and not the bug

	Modified make_mask()
	This version of make_mask() no longer takes a Grid size as its first
	two arguments; now it takes a 'shape string' that provides the number
	and size of each dimension of the resulting mask. However, I realized
	that was probably not needed since that same info can come from the
	dimensions that are passed in. I'm commiting this version, all the
	same.

2015-05-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the name of dilate_array to dilate_mask
	But left the C++ files DilateArrayFunction.cc/h since changing those
	takes more effort.

	Copyright date correction

	Added the dilate_array() function to the handler and added reg. tests

	Fixed some minor compilation issues in DilateArrayFunction

2015-05-26  dh-opendap  <d.holloway@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'uri-mask' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into uri-mask

	Updated functionsTest.at

2015-05-26  Dan Holloway  <dan@Dans-MBP.home>

	Added DilateArrayFunction

2015-05-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hacked version of make_mase()
	For this version, floating point values only have to be <= 0.1 different
	to match. This is a hack, but we can revisit it later. It's in Jira.

	Fixed/Added tests for make_mask()
	I moved and renamed the initial test bescmd file from tests/functions
	to tests/bescmd/make_mask_coads_{1,2}.bescmd and changed the data set
	the the coads.dods file in tests/data (that is read using dapreader).
	Both tests pass and it seems like the values are correct.

	Added 'optimization' for Odometer::set_indices()
	Removed multiply by one.

	Added 3D test for make_mask
	also reformatted Odometer.h

	Removed DODS_DEBUG; added 2D unit test for make_mask_helper

	Initial unit test - a one-dimensional case

	Merge branch 'uri-mask' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into uri-mask

	Added extract_uint_value() to functions_util.h
	..,just needed a declaration. Also added some documentation to the make
	mask helper.

2015-05-25  Dan Holloway  <dan@Dans-MBP.home>

	Added mask_coads test files.

	Added extract_uint_value(), and returned DAP Array from MakeMaskFunction.

2015-05-24  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added BES command to timing log

2015-05-22  Dan Holloway  <dan@Dans-MBP.fios-router.home>

	updated to use odometer::set_indices

2015-05-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added set_indices() to Odometer.
	...and tests

	Added all_indices_valid() function
	Also added a test, just to be complete...

	Minor compiler error in MakeMaskFunction.cc fixed

2015-05-22  Dan Holloway  <dan@Dans-MBP.home>

	Including odometer construction.

	Updated, removing #if0, and converted to mask to vector<byte>

2015-05-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modifications to MakeMaskFunction
	The code compiles. To get that I used #if 0 ... endif to remove some of
	the code (because it called functions that haven't been written). I
	added two new functions that I hope will make it easier to build up
	information needed to set pixels in the mask. I added unit tests for
	those new functions.

	Added unit test for find_value_indices()

	Added a unit test for find_value_index().

	Added a proto-unit-test for Make Mask

	Merge branch 'uri-mask' of https://github.com/opendap/bes.git into uri-mask

2015-05-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Module update (commit and push)

	modules sync

	Formatting

	Now functions/swath2grid builds correctly; it is not included, however.
	Repaired the configure search for gdal. Also fixed an
	error in the software. This code is not, however, included
	in the build by default. It's just not quite ready. Modify
	functions/Makefile.am to build/use it.

	Call setgroups() before relinquishing root.

2015-05-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Making it easier to build dapreader-uasable data for tests
	...but it's still not 100% there. DAP2 Grids fail.

	Removed old cruft about functions module from dapreader/tests/bes.conf.in

	Fixed an issue with --without-dap-modules

	Fixed getopt() use. Patch from O. Poplawski.

2015-05-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Formatting; BESKeys default ctor lacked field inializers.

2015-05-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	All-static module build now works.

2015-05-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Simple formatting fixes for code in 'functions'

	Fixed problems in besd and bescmdln
	The besd script failed with installed from the rpm because the
	bes prefix was set to /usr and then passed to besctl, which broke
	all kinds of things. I removed that and the unused exec_prefix
	and 'source functions' lines. Also, bescmdln logic made it so
	that the value given with -p was ignored.

2015-05-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added #include <iterator> to MaskArrayFunctionTest.cc
	...for CentOS 6

2015-05-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed DAP4 function evaluation
	There was a bug where the result of the function was followed
	by a dump of the entire DMR.

	Reformatted files

	Fixed an integration test for mask_array()
	The test used the wrong variable. I also found that some of the
	data files used by the integration tests were not in git.

	Added (more) test baselines for mask_array()

2015-04-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the mask_array() function to the functions module
	... and added regression tests for mask_array(). DAP4 function working
	although there's a bug with the libdap evaluator code.

	mask_array() unit tests include a test for the DAP4 version.

	mask_array() now has complete QC and more tests

2015-04-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Proto version of mask_array()
	Helper function working and unit tests written

2015-04-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	checkpoint: Adding mask_array() server function

	Formatting edits to MakeArrayFunction.cc/h

2015-04-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed typo in configure_modules.ac
	GRIDFIELDS was spelled incorrectly.

2015-04-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Gridfields fix
	configure was not finding libgridfields - or rather - when it
	did find it in the supplied dependencies, the library was not
	used.

	doxygen fixes
	doxy.conf is now a generated file.

2015-04-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	submodule commits

	Added #include of <cstdlib> for OdometerTest
	C++ failed to sort out the abs() overload without <cstdlib>. ...but
	not on OSX.

2015-04-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	distcheck now works with configure_modules.ac

2015-04-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ChangeLog, NEWS, READ and INSTALL updates for 3.14
	This includes updates to the ChangeLog and version information
	for all of the submodule handlers.

2015-04-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Version number in NEWS to 3.14.0

	Bumped up the versions in the spec files for libdap
	...now libdap/-devel 3.14.0 is required.

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes
	Conflicts:
		modules/csv_handler

	Updated relese version numbers in configure.ac and the spec files.

	Added to teh fortify target for the bes.

2015-04-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Makefile.am now supports a new 'all-static' rpm.
	This target (all-static-rpm) expects to find the dependencies for
	all of the handlers either on a plain RHEL6 machine or in the special
	static dependencies installed in $prefix/deps where $prefix is set
	in the shell and used as the value of --prefix to the hyrax-dependencies
	project. This requires that the hyrax-dependencies be built with this
	static linking in mind.

2015-04-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the besd script.
	Now it installs in /etc/rc.d/init.d like a good system V daemon
	init script and has the run levels set properly. This requires
	RHEL 6.

2015-04-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Pushed the NSIDC changes to fileout_netcdf; updating submodule

2015-03-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	New commits in the submodules
	Mostly ignored generated conf files but there are
	some build fixes too (for 'make check' when CppUnit
	is not present).

	Fixed an issue with gridfileds tests
	There was a syntax error plus a botched test.

2015-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	dap-server update

2015-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed rpm name
	RPM has odd rules about what chars can appear where

	Added NASA-specific RPM spec file
	see bes.spec.nasa

2015-03-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	Accomodate autoconf 2.63
	Modifications to the submodules

	Change configure_modules.ac: autoconf version changed (back) to 2.63.
	Also changed calls to AT_ARG_OPTION_ARG so that the multi-word options
	use underscores and not dashes (needed for 2.63 but not later versions).

	Modifications to make a 'NASA' rpm
	This will include hdfeos2 and hdf4 statically linked to the
	hdf4_handler because that's what has to be. I have added a new
	target in the Makefile (nasarpm) that will do this and made
	changes to configure so that a partial build of the dependencies
	will provide the stuff needed.
	Note that the hdf4 library is still not linking statically! Return
	to this ASAP.

2015-03-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the RPM targets

2015-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	RPM now builds correctly from the command line...
	...the Makefile target needs some work though, because rpmbuild
	is confused by the multiple spec files in the tar.gz. Either remove
	them or run rpmbuild -ba or -bb and pass in the spec file on that
	command line. Could make the dist, but will need to copy it to
	the rpmbuild topdir/SOURCES.

	CentOS distcheck now works!

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	Updated all the submodules for the distcheck changes.

	Merged from stash after switching back to master.

	Various changes for distcheck.

2015-03-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'jg_distcheck' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into jg_distcheck
	Conflicts:
		configure_modules.ac

	minor edit to configure_modules.ac

	Modified configure.ac
	Now 'pax' tar is used to build the dist so the long filenames
	in the hdf4 and 5 handlers don't force a build fail. I also
	cleaned up the functions and functions/swath2grid Makefile.am
	files.

	Fixes for distcheck
	For the bes.conf files, use the test's Makefile.am to build the
	conf file so that we can strip the ../ from @abs_top_srcdir@. I also
	fixed some botched include directives where files were included
	using 'dispatch/BESDebug.h', etc., which will clearly break using
	distcheck.

	Removed dap/tests from the build
	The tests in this code depend on dapreader, but that dir is not built
	until this one has finished!

	Change pushed for fo json

	New module commits

	Modules update

	Updated baselines in functions/tests
	dapreader uses series values from the Test* classes and I moved the
	tests here from dapreader (since this is where the functions are defined
	and this code is built after the dapreader code - so the tests were
	not being run back in the dapreader dir).

2015-03-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Cleaned up the ResponseBuilder & ResponseCache tests.
	They used system("rm ...") and I added "2>/dev/null" to cut down on the
	extra error messages.

	Ignore the messy merge from an old stash until I have time to look it over carefully.

	...working on distcheck
	This is a checkpoint on my branch.

	Moved tests for DAP4 functions here from dapreader.

	I moved the function tests to 'functions'.
	In the main Makefile.am, 'functions' is built after this directory.
	Thus, the function module is not normally available when dapreader is
	first built.

	I removed the AggregationServer class for Sequence.
	The code is still in git, but not part of the build or the tests.

2015-03-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a duplicate delete bug; added tests.
	Found and fixed an issue in tabular when building tables of arrays of
	differing sizes. In that case, BaseType* were being copied, not
	duplicated. Later the Sequence dtor deleted all the pointers, causing
	a duplicate delete operation. Bummer. Lots of pointer dups now...

	Removed roi() function tests and added modified submodules

	In BESCatalog.h: shortened the private ctor to a declaration
	...because that's all you need and you don't get warnings about
	missing initializations.

	Additions to tabular() - more sanity checking
	...but no more tests. One issue found with integration testing when
	asking for tables from arrays where the independent variables have rank
	N and the dependent have rank N+1 and one or more granule has no data
	that match the selection criteria.

2015-03-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for different dimensions to tabular()
	The first version of tabular() required all arrays to be the same size.
	The new version supports the case where one or more array is one
	dimension larger than the rest of the arrays. The tests pass, but there
	is still considerable work to do for the code to be ready for use.

	Fixed the roi() baselines so they pass.
	A better fix would be to subclass the types (Byte, ...) in dapreader
	so that it is not using the Test* types. See Trac...

2015-03-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated fo json

2015-03-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'agg_server'

	Updated hashes for the agg_server branch

	Updated the modules hashes

	Added integration tests for tabular()

	Addition to TabularSequence so that selection expressions work
	I modified TabularSequence so that selection expressions work for both
	binary (aka dods) and ASCII responses. I also modified the tests so
	there are fewer warnings about mismatched sizes and added some comments
	to TabularFunction

	Minor refactor in BESDapResponseBuilder
	I changed some logic that was especially hard to follow and looked at
	making the send_dap2_data() method easier to use in other code, esp.
	in the asciival handler.

2015-03-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' into agg_server
	Conflicts:
		Makefile.am
		functions/TabularFunction.cc
		modules/w10n_handler

2015-03-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge after stash pop

	Merged after a pull of agg_server
	I needed to build the agg_server branch on the
	AWS test-mule running CentOS 6 and in the process
	fixed a number of issues - it might have been
	more savvy to have built/fixed the master and then
	merged down to agg_server, but ...

2015-03-04  opendap  <support@opendap.org>

	Fixes for building on CentOS 6
	Most of the build issues cover #include filenames where
	OSX is not case sensitive but linux is. Some other issues
	are somewhat perplexing (a missing call to generate package.m4).
	Also, the tests for the dap module contain some baselines
	that use hash values that are machine/os specific and I've
	removed those for now.

2015-03-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed distclean in standalone

	Fixed distclean in cmdln

	BBoxFunction supports N-dim boxes
	Based on the 'Odometer' class; includes tests. I verified
	that the 1-d and 2-d tests pass when using the
	general algorithm but did not add any 3-d tests.

2015-03-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Copied the roi() tests to standalone (from cmdln)
	I'm starting to think that we should have a special dir for
	end-to-end tests where the whole server is used but still does
	not have to be installed. By making the dir separate from the
	code, we can make sure it is listed last and/or not listed
	if the modules are not built as part of the bes build.

	Added one more test file for the roi() code

	Added Odometer class; modified tests.
	Odometer will be used to make a general bbox() function - one that works
	for arrays with any number of dimensions and ne that can be used to
	make minimal boxes that are the unions of regions, not other boxes.
	I also tweaked the test code and marked most of the regression tests
	as xfail since they will until we fix dapreader (Trac #2286). Lastly,
	I added a subset version of the Modis 04 file that's easier to use
	for tests since it's possible to figure out if the bbox/roi code is
	working.

	Added more tests for the BBoxUnionFunction class.

2015-02-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	One new baseline...

	Partial code review
	Added comments; removed an unused function; and modified one
	to be a bit more useful when errors are found.

	Added a 2d bbox unit test.

2015-02-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed BBoxUnion so it handles 'intersection'
	Added tests, but only for 1d bboxes; need to add tests for two
	dimensions.

	Added unit-tests for BBoxUnion.
	I know there are problems with "intersection"; "union" looks
	OK, but the test needs to be completed.

	Added to gitignore

	Added tests for roi(); interection mode for bbox_union
	These seem to round out the roi(), bbox() and bbox_union()
	functions. I'm going to work more on better end-to-end testing
	that does not use the cmdln tool (which means that the server
	much be installed and running).

2015-02-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added baseline for bbox_union test

	Added working code to BBoxUnionFunction
	...and one test. Now we need a real bounding box function!

	Added nascent version of BBoxUnion.
	Not done, but compiles.

	Refactor RoiFunction
	Moved the bbox utils to their own file so I can use them with the
	bbox_union() function.

	Comments added/fixed
	I poked around in the BES code with Patrick on the
	phone and added some notes, TODOs, etc. Mostly these
	came about while we were talking about aggregation
	and the multiple container code in the BES.

	I fixed debug builds
	Now debug (./configure --enable-developer) builds of
	the BES copile the sources using -O0 and -g3.

	Simple tests of roi() using installed handlers.
	This is the first of the end-to-end tests for the server
	function. These test if the function runs using the
	dap module evaluator (different than using besstandalone
	or a unit-test!) and if the output can be chained
	to other transmitters like fileout_netcdf (it can).
	The tests work, but I have not 'made them automatic'
	yet because I'm not sure what that would mean for
	typical builds (i.e., I think the the BES has to be
	installed for these to work).

	More testing for the roi() and bbox() functions.
	Added unit and regression tests, fixed a few bugs
	and started on end-to-end testing.

	Initial stab at regression tests for roi() and bbox()
	The bbox() function is still dumb; it always returns a 10x10
	box. However, these tests show that roi() wrks with hdf4 data
	and inout from bbox().

	Added a two-array test for the roi() function.

2015-02-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added gitignore and some ignores to functions/unit-tests

	More roi() tests
	Test with a 2d array pass and with 2 1d arrays look good but need
	more work.

	Initial version of roi()
	This version of roi() subsets (slices) N arrays using a 'slice'
	array like that produced by the bbox() function also recently added.
	Tested for one 1-d array only so far

	Initial version of bbox(). Placeholder.
	The function is fully formed _except_ that it lacks a way to
	actually determine the bounding box. That will come later once
	I have the other functions coded and tested. The commit includes
	two unit tests. DAP2 only.

2015-02-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added bescmd for tabular() with multiple containers.
	However, in the BES's current configuration, this doesn't make much
	sense, so this is mostly checked in as a place holder to keep the idea
	alive and not something that should actually work.

	Added example aggregation BES commands.
	These don't all work, but they are useful examples, all the same.

	Reverted to teh old dataset name behavior in dapreader.
	Dataset names from .dods and .data files use the name
	in the Dataset {} <name>; syntax element and not the
	filename. I also checked in some changes in dap-server,
	fo json (from a merge) and ncml_module.

2015-02-19  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added w10n_handler submodule to bes preoject.

2015-02-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added to gitignore

	SequenceAggregationServer ready for more testing
	Added regression tests for the Sequence AS and they pass. However,
	testing using the libdap TestSequence class is of limited used because
	it does not know about stored values. I'm commiting this and will
	test against the TabularSequence type returned by the tabular()
	function in the functins module.

	Added regression tests for the Sequence Aggregation Server
	...but not baselines for some because they fail.

	Sequence Aggregation Server check point
	The Sequence Aggregation Server will process a DDS response correctly,
	returning the DDS for the aggregated result. The DataDDS response is
	still a work in progress...

	Unit tests for the new Sequence Aggregation Server

2015-02-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed dapreader so that it supports multiple containers.
	When reading from a dap2 or dap4 data response, the code in
	Connect is not 'container safe' so this handler reads into a
	temporary DDS and then transfers the resulting variables. At
	this point, processing global attributes is not handled for
	a multi-container response (but it's hard to know how that
	should be handled by this code).

2015-02-11  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Replaced use of unique_ptr with auto_ptr for compiler luddites like myself.

2015-02-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed from unique_ptr to auto_ptr
	gcc 4.2 on OS/X 10.7 does not support unique_ptr yet.

	Updated the gitignore files in dap-server and fo json.

2015-02-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The dapreader 'error' tests use a pattern rule now.
	A persistent problem with the tests here that check the parser's
	detection of errors was that the baselines were compared to
	the output using a litteral match. When the source line numbers
	changed, the tests failed (i.e., every time the code was
	edited). I switched to an AT_...PATTERN... test driver, modified
	the baselines to contain just the txt of the error message,and
	the problem went away.

	Minor tweak to GridGeoConstraint test
	I added some initializer code to quite a warning.

	Reactivated the regression tests in dap
	Modified configure_modules.ac, the tests, etc. However,
	at this point the tests actually do nothing - these were
	completely broken. I will start out adding some tests for
	the new AggregationServer handler added to this dir.

2015-02-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added Sequence AggregationServer, 0.1

	Merge branch 'master' into agg_server

	Added some generated scripts to gitignore

	Fixed the indentation of BESDapResponseBuilder.cc
	No functional change

	Merge branch 'tabular'
	This adds the tabular() function. The tabular function
	takes one or more arrays that meet certain criteria and
	builds a table from their values. Each array is one
	columnn in the table (sequence). A subclass of libdap::Sequence
	is defined to make serialization and ce evaluation work
	correctly. Includes tests.

	TabularSequence now supports selection.
	I modified the serialize() method of TabukarSequence so
	that it supports selection expressions. It's not the best
	in terms of performance (I suspect; no actuall performance
	measurement yet). Also, configure_modules.ac supports the
	new regression tests.

2015-02-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added unit tests for the D4 version of tabular()

	Added a test baseline for tabular

	Initial regression tests for tabular - working
	I subclassed Sequence to get the DAP2 version of tabular to
	work. The issue was that Sequence::serialize is broken WRT
	a sequence that is already loaded with data values.

	Added tests for tabular

	Added to functions/tests/data so the data work with dapreader
	I added a bes conf file (build_responses.conf) that will work
	to build .dods, ..., files from netcdf data files so that we
	can test using real data without having to first build specific
	format handlers.

2015-02-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added two gitignore files

	New an improved version of tabular()
	The function now works correctly with N arrays and tests their
	shape for correctness (all arrays must match in shape for this
	version of the function). Also included are unit tests.

2015-02-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	New changes in the modules.

	The new AggregationServer.

	Added initial version of tabular().
	This version of tabular() works witj a single one dimension
	array and may work with others, but is untested for those cases.
	Has a unit test file.

	The agg_server branch
	Partial progress on an AggregationServer. This code is a
	'null aggregation server' that prints out information about
	the DHI it gets passed. Maybe useful later on...

	Repaired fragile tests
	These tests failed because the line number of the code
	that throws an exception changed. We need to change how
	tests like this compare against their baseline - use a
	regex or just test for an error return?

	Added info about DAP2 vs DAP4 to README and INSTALL

2015-02-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

2015-02-02  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	Simplifed the check_path() function by using a function pointer to
	eliminate two identical logic paths that utilized two different
	version of the stat function depending on the value of a passed
	paramter. The new verion assigns a function pointer based on the
	value of the parameter and then only one block of logic follows.
	This simplifies maintenence and readability. Additionally added
	from debugging instrumentation.

2015-01-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added some new test code to dapreader
	The new tests are for Sequences and multi-container requests
	where each containers is a sequence. This was added as part of the
	NASA work on Swath aggregation.

	Fixed an issue with multiple containers and dapreader
	The dapreader handler failed when containers were used and the DAS
	was empty because a test in DDS::transfer_attr() that checked for a
	matching hierarchy between the two objects (DAS and DDS) would fail.
	I patched this by no calling transfer_attr() when the DAS is empty.

2015-01-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed an error in configure_modules.ac
	The header 'strings.h' was misspelled 'trings.h'.

2015-01-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed dist-hook which as a hack for SVN.
	I updated the modules as well, commiting them too.
	Also, I added LT_INIT in the bes configure_modules.ac.

2015-01-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed my too-hastily applied patch to BindName.
	I modified the D4 function parser in libdap so that string constants
	do not include the double quotes that delimit their values. The call
	to remove_quotes() here was then redundant.

2015-01-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed test issues in dapreader
	These issues were actually due to a subtle change in the DAP4 function
	parser. Sting constants are now returned with their double quotes.
	This is so that variable names can be passed into functions even when
	those names are quoted (because they contain spaces or meta
	characters). The tests assumed unquoted names. I wonder about this,
	but I'm checking in the fix and adding a note to jira/trac.

	Added empty cache dirs
	We need four cache dirs to make the tests in dap/unit-tests
	work correctly. I added these 'empty' dirs by putting a crafty
	gitignore file in them and adding it to the index.

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/dap4'
	Conflicts:
		dap/unit-tests/ResponseCacheTest.cc
		dapreader/Makefile.am
		dapreader/bes-testsuite/Makefile.am

2014-12-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated INSTALL and README
	They now contain text describing git and the two ways the
	code can be built.

	Fixed configre_modules.ac - stuff got lost in the merge

	Moved configure.ac to configure_standard.ac
	The 'mosules' build uses a new configure.ac and several
	AM_CONDITIONAL variables; the standard build configure.ac
	does not and there's no way to make automake be 'conditional'
	itself. So... There are two configure.ac files, one named
	..._modules and the other named ..._standard. Thre's no
	file named 'configure.ac' in git so that builders don't forget
	to switch.

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/modules'
	Conflicts:
		configure.ac
	Last set of changes made on the modules branch regarding the
	dist target and building from the tarball.

	Changes so that make dist and a build of the tarball work.

	Restored the 'standard' build configure.ac
	This code will now support both the standard build where
	the bes alone builds - autoreconf -fiv followed by the
	usual suspects will build and install the bes framework.
	Copying the configure_modules.ac to configure.ac and running
	those commands after using git's submodule commands to clone
	the Hyrax module set will build the bes and all of the modules.
	See INSTALL for more information.

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/modules'
	Conflicts:
		dap/unit-tests/response_cache/.gitignore

2014-12-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Module updates - specifically to factor setting the module name
	and version information out of the configure script and into the
	module's Makefile.am

2014-12-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes in csv, dap-server and ncml.

	Removed besregtest from the rpm spec file

	The spec file now requires 3.13.3

	Added directory response_cache.

2014-12-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the gitmodules file for ugrid and ncml.
	Both of these lacked a 'branch = modules' line, so the submodule
	update command was using the master branch.

	Fixed the dapreader regression tests.
	These tests were commented out and the dapreader handler/module was
	linked with several of the bes libraries. This meant that other
	tests that used the module were broken.

	Added ugrid_functions to the bes modules build.

2014-12-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for the bes modules build.

	Added hdf5_handler to the bes modules build.
	Also fixed issues in the gateway module test code and pushed
	those to github.

2014-11-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added hdf4_handler to the bes modules build.

2014-11-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the *.conf files to git ignore

	Added gdal_handler to the bes modules build.

	Added the fits_handler to the bes modules build.

2014-11-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed configure.ac when --without-dap-modules is used.

	Fixed configure.ac so that FOUND_OPENJPEG is defiend even if BUILD_GDAL is not.

2014-11-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tweaked the xml handler module given that hdf4/5 are not yet working.

	Added fieout_gdal to the BES modules build

	Modified .gitmodules so that it tracks the modules branch of gateway_module by default.

	Added gateway_module to the BES modules branch/build.

	Added fileout_netcdf to the BES modules build.

	Added netcdf_handler to the bes modules build.

2014-11-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modifications for the modules build.
	Added the Freeform and xml_data handlers. The dist target works, as
	does make install.

2014-11-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the freeform handler to the modules build.

2014-11-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Configured submodules to use the 'modules' branch
	I editied the .gitmodules file so that csv, fileout json and
	dap-server call should use the 'modules' branch by default when
	cloned using the bes 'modules' branch.

	Found and fixed the ResponseCacheTest error.
	The problem with the ResponsecacheTest unit test was that it
	depended on the 'response_cache' directory already existing. But
	git does not (it seems) fetch/update/etc. empty directories. I
	added a .gitignore file in the directory and set it to ignore
	everything except the .gitignore file.

	Added fileout_json to the modules build.

	Changes in the modules dirs for csv and dap-server.

	Added more handlers to the modules branch
	Tweaked the configure.ac file so that dap-server now builds; the
	configure script now has some new makefile variables for handlers
	to use when linking unit-tests. I added the dap-server, fileout_json,
	freeform and xml_data handlers to this branch.

2014-11-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Support for the 'modules' build
	Modified configure.ac so that it will build the Makefiles for all of
	the modules in the new modules subdir. Added 'subdir-objects' to the
	Makefile.am files in the bes build that need it (to suppress the wordy
	warning message). Also added .gitignore.

	Added csv_handler in modules dir

2014-10-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added include of D4Dimensions.h
	M    functions/BindShapeFunction.cc

2014-10-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I re-indented this code because it was too hard to read.

	Added more tests and fixed 2256 where a .dods response, frozen to
	a file and a .das response were not being merged correctly. The
	problem was that the bescmd file had to specify that the context
	'use_explicit_containers' was set to 'no'. Not setting this caused
	the handler to fail when trying to read the DAS file.

2014-10-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for ticket 2258 - Modules with names that contained the string
	'dap' were loaded before the dap module. Fixed.

	Added fix for bug 2258 where the module fails to load. The problem
	seems to be in the BES itself and the way that modules are loaded,
	but a fix is to change the name of the module in the conf
	file (from 'dapreader' to anything that does not contain the
	string 'dap').

	Removed cruft

2014-09-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added some tests for the DAP4 functions using the code in the
	functions module - might move this to the functions module in the
	near future...

	Added some tests for the DAP4 functions using the code in the
	functions module - might move this to the functions module in the
	near future...
	
	I imposed some sanity on the organization of the test data files.

	Added DAP4 a function eval call to the send dap4 data code. I also
	cleared out some of the old boolean stuff inherited from DAP2's ce
	eval code.

	Log message text fix

2014-09-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed comment

2014-09-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed the old OPENDAP_DEBUG_OPTIONS macro from many configure.ac files.

2014-09-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a few files for DAP2 Sequences as part of testing issues
	with nested sequences in DAP4. ...need to organize the dap2 versus
	dap4 files here a bit better if/when we start using this for more
	tests. ...unless the data for those tests are kept in the handlers
	that uses them.

2014-09-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed an unneeded use of auto_ptr.

2014-09-08  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Spelling

	Another fix for the unit-tests in bes/dap - I think the cache dirs
	are finally cleaned properly.

	I found that the test for escaped pathnames was failing and the
	baseline was bogus. I added a ticket, modified the baseline to
	contain a note about the ticket and made that test 'xfail'.

	Updated README

	Added support for DAP4 responses from DAP2 response files. The
	code may not work for DAP2 responses that contain Structure or
	Sequences. For these to work we may need to subclass the TestType
	implementations for those classes.

	Added support for DAP4 responses from DAP4 data response files.
	made the DAP2 responses more general (including support for DAP2
	dds responses from DAP2 data response files). No support for DAP4
	stuff from DAP2 response files yet - not sure if this is needed.

2014-09-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Reading .dap documents now works for both .dmr and .dap
	requests (although there are some issues like DAP4_Checksum_CRC32
	appearing in DMR responses and appearing twice in DAP responses).
	DAP2 object/response support not added. All tests still pass.

	Modified dapreader so that it will build a DMR from both
	DMR/XML (text) files and .dap response files. This same basic code
	can be extended to include building DAP4 responses from DDS and
	DataDDS 'files'. The intent is that getdap and getdap4 will be
	used to build the data files and this handler will be able to feed
	DMR/DDS objects into Transmitter handlers. I also removed the
	unused SupportDAP4 parameter from the dapreader.conf.in file.

	Added comment about a leak fix.

2014-08-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	svn ignores

	Fixed the tests so they run correctly using make check -j9 - they
	did not work correctly with a parallel build.

2014-08-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the dapreader issues; fixed some issues in the Makefile.am files regarding distcheck.

2014-08-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Spelling in an error message

	fixed the name of the dapreader module in the template bes conf
	file that's used for the handler install

2014-08-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Now gets the xml:base context and sets the correct part of the DMR object

2014-08-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I remove the unlock_and_close(int fd) method of
	BESFileLockingCache because it did not update the list of open
	descriptors - the version of this method that takes a filename
	argument does. Mixing the two methods lead to descriptors being
	closed twice. The bug did not show up here but it did on the dap4
	branch.

	Fixed an error BESFileLockingCache where a cached file could be
	unlocked using its file descriptor and not its name. Doing so
	meant that the recorded descriptor was left on a list of
	descriptors to close and then would be 'closed twice' in some
	cases. I also fixed an error in the Makefile.am for the unit tests
	in dap where the installed libraries were used instead of the
	build libraries (in the source directories). Other changes/fixes
	are the result of adding support for the DMR response to the CSV
	handler.

2014-08-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	All the latest changes from the trunk including the 1.9.9 changes
	- the previous merge likely got the changes up to 1.9.8, not 1.9.9
	as the comment says.

	Merged code from the trunk so that the changes there for the last
	set of Hyrax releases will be available. This includes changes up
	to version 1.9.9 of Hyrax

	Quick fix for bug #2194 - the BES cache opens files twice but closes them only once when working with compressed files. This is a quick fix where both BESCache3 and BESFileLockingCache have been hacked. The tests are sort of hosed because they use the old caching code - which I have removed along with BESDAPCache. The old unused code made this problem take much longer to find. Next I'll try making BESCache3 a child of FileLockingCache.

2014-03-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added headers for strerror and errno (cerrno and cstring).

2014-03-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Refactored code in SocketListener and PPTServer so that key
	methods no longer contain infinite loops so signal
	processing (which I separated from signal reception) can be
	centralized in each of ServerApp.cc and daemon.cc. Each of those
	build servers/daemons that have specialized treatment of signals
	like HUP, TERM and CHLD. This will close ticket 2025 and 2139.

2014-03-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I modified the Socket::receive() code along with

	PPTConnection::readChunkHeader() complains wehn it gets that and
	it was not expected.

2014-02-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for ticket 2025. The code in welcomeClient() used a
	non-blocking read to do the initial handshake with the connecting
	client. It was the case that sometimes the non-blocking read would
	not read the client's handshake under high load conditions. See
	the ticket for the long version...

	Modified dap/unit-tests so that it links against the module
	'library' file and does not try to build its own versions of the
	classes its testing. This fixed a linkage issue that was really
	quite bizarre where libbes_dispatch.dylib was referenced by an
	absolute path. I also found two paces where OSX 10.9 required some
	more headers (sys/select.h and unistd.h)

2014-01-29  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Applied patch from Ezequiel Lara Gómez
	<ezequiel.lara@qualitasremos.com> for long option support in

2013-12-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I fixed a spelling error in a comment and a bad default value in
	the dap.conf.in file. In the latter case the conf file was
	providing a path value for the function cache that had double
	quotes and those are not removed by the BES 'keys' code.

	bes: More instrumentation for PPT_EXIT_NOW handling

2013-10-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added code to log receipt of the EXIT_NOW PPT token. Also, added
	some more comments about where different parts of the socket I/O
	code are implemented. I think these changes, combined with others
	recently made, fix the issues we've seen on Linux where the OLFS
	encounters I/O failures when it 'uses up' a BES and retires it for
	a new beslistener child. This should also address the ticket that
	requests a log entry when the BES 'dies' since the exit code and
	signal handlers now log information.

2013-10-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified Socket::receive() so that it handles EINTR and EAGAIN
	correctly on read() calls to the socket.

2013-10-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The command line client now sends the zero-length chunk that
	follows the EXIT_NOW extension chunk that indicates to the server
	that the client has closed the PPT connection.

2013-10-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the way the EXIT_NOW state/chunk is handled by the
	BESServerHandler class (it should be looking for a trailing
	zero-length chunk following the 'extension' chunk that indicates
	'EXIT_NOW').

2013-10-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	fixed the return code info for child processes; bescmdln now has
	defaults for/of localhost and port 10022

2013-10-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Commented out the calls to terminate/exit in the sig pipe handler
	of the beslistener.

2013-10-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed "besdaemon" and "server" to "beslistener" in the BESDEBUG

	Updated the FSF address in the copyright headers; added missing
	copyright information.

2013-09-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This checkin contains a fix for the conflicting definitions of
	width() in BaseType, Vector and Array, where Array provided a
	version/definition that clashes with the one in BaseType. BaseType
	defined width() and Array defined width(bool constrained = true),
	which shadowed the former. I changed BaseType width so that its
	signature is width(bool constrained = false) and made that the
	only version of the method. There are some changes to uses of
	width() in libdap and the BES, but not in the handlers.

2013-09-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a set_dds() method to BESDDSResponse and BESDataDDSResponse.
	This enables a handler to subclass the DDS/DataDDS and have the
	BES use that subclass. This is a way for handlers to manage
	resources like files, for example, by arranging to have those
	files closed with the (specialized) DDS's dtor is run.

2012-04-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified bes.conf.in to accommodate the new cache for compressed files. The cache no longer uses retry times.

2012-04-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed an issue in BESCache3 where files where not closed when a nonblocking lock could not be obtained on a file.

2012-04-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the Makefile.am in bes/dispatch/unit-tests

2012-04-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tuning plus a fix for purging where files are not locked exclusively during the purge.

2012-04-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESCache3 improvements: Atomic shared and exclusive lock
	acquisition simplifies use; purge and cache info code now manages
	its own locks so the caller doesn't need to; shared locks used
	where they make sense. Passes tests. Fixed BESFileContainer.cc so
	that it uses a compile-time switch to choose between the original
	cache and the new one.

2012-04-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified the 'cache lock' so that it keeps the cache info (i.e.
	lock file) open for the duration and thus can use fcntl(2)
	atomically to set and release locks.

2012-04-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Working; optimization to decompress values w/o the cache being locked works. Saves about 20% of time with four processes.

2012-04-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Cleaned up the Cache3 code so that the old variants of lock-here versus lock-there are removed.

2012-04-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This version of the code correctly handles the case where the cache is not locked during decompression. It works on both OSX and Linux. There's still room for improvement and performance tests, but this can be used.

2012-04-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More changes; working on the deadlock issue that arises when the cache is unlocked during the decompression operations.

2012-04-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The fcntl(2) locking works on linux, but I found an issue with the uncompress functions - they close the dest file, which releases the lock. Modified the code for GZ and will do more testing.

2012-04-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated for linux build

	M    dispatch/unit-tests/BESCache3Test.cc

2012-04-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Problem in isLocked() fixed - was not closing file after testing.

2012-04-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESCache3 is fixed an optimized so that it does not lock the cache during the file decompression, which means it allows simultaneous decompressions and reads. The cache is locked during file lock acqusition and cache purge operations. Still more testing, however...

2012-04-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESCache3 works but still has to lock the entire cache for both the shared and exclusive lock access. Work on this; test on Linux.

2012-03-31  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESCache3 and BESUncompressManager3 appear to work now. They pass the same stress test that BESCache2 passes

	BESCache2 broken - checkpoint.

2012-03-29  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Cache code appears to pass tests - 5 processes simultaneously accessing the cache 2000 times each where there are far more compressed files than will fit in the cache at one time (so there are lots of purge operations). There may be ways to improve its performance a bit...

2012-03-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Cache code. Testing, race condition with cache purging.

2012-03-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	some headway on the multiprocess tests...

2012-03-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed some minor issues in the cache code - unnecessary recalculation of sizes, normalized the cache to always use sizes in bytes but take configuration in sizes in megabytes, streamline error messages (need to check on that).

2012-03-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Improved cache purge code by changing the 'head room' param to 20%. Also fixed a problem where the megs versus bytes things were broken.

2012-03-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESCache2 might be working - single process tests appear to work; have not tried multiprocess tests yet. Must work on some other stuff for a bit...

2012-03-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	caching: basic tests pass

2012-03-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	checkpoint for the BESCache2 code - not quite working...

2012-02-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the broken bes.pid file problem when using rpms. The problem was caused by having the besdaemon write the pid file after switching its UID from root. To fix this I changed when the pid file is written so that it is written by root. I aslo changed the directory where its written (likely not actually needed given the first change) so that the rpm-installed bes writes the pid file to /var/run/bes/bes.pid and the /var/run/bes dir is group writable by bes. This might be useful if the bes is ever run in developer mode from an RPM (unlikely, but...)

	Making this a real handler
	A    http://scm.opendap.org/svn/trunk/csv_handler
	D    http://scm.opendap.org/svn/trunk/bes/csv-handler

2011-02-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Support for the new ResponseBuilder class - this replaces
	DODSFilter, dropping that class' baggage from the CGI days and
	includes the ability to parse CE keywords (although we might not
	use this ultimately). Also, this checking includes a patch for the
	ticket 1710 where the hdf4 handler seems to have a memory bug that
	causes a seg fault when the handler is removed.

2011-02-07  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added d_lib = 0 to the code in BESPlugin.h that calls dlclose().

2011-02-03  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Removed, no longer used.
	D    csv-handler/dap_csv_handler.cc

2011-02-03  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Reverse order in termination as was in initialization. Fixed a couple
	issues in BESRegex. ContainerStorageCatalog was calling include and
	exclude on a node when include already calls exclude internally.
	Converted CatalogUtils to use BESRegex instead of GNURegex from libdap.

	because the data have moved.

	M    testsuite/besTest.at

2011-02-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Patch for ticket 1702 - this patch is for the problem where modules
	don't 'unplug' correctly and sometimes crash the beslistener/besstandalone.
	It's not a fix, but the ncml_module now passes its tests.

	M    BESPlugin.h

	o Fix for newer GCC complaining about extra qualification in header for new func (can't put the classname scope operator in the declaration, only definition)

2010-12-29  mjohnson

	o Fixes to make the cache work for caches sizes > 4Gb (i.e. 64 bit rather than 32 bit).  For ticket #1672.

	o Changes to the unit test are NOT on by default since they make a large test dir.  To run this test, one must do it by hand:  "dispatch/unit-tests/cacheT --do-64-bit-test"

2010-12-16  mjohnson

	Removed incorrect dist of missing nc dir in bes-testsuite so that make dist works

2010-12-16  mjohnson

	Fixed undefined symbol error due to not linking against libbes_dap in Makefile.

2010-10-28  mjohnson

	Merge from Hyrax 1.6.2 Release Shrew branch.  More odd property changes that seem to be noops but refuse to just go away.

2010-10-28  mjohnson

	o dispatch/BESResponseHandler.h: doc fix

	o xmlcommand/BESXMLUtils.cc: switch a vsprint to use vsnprint to avoid buffer overflow.

	o hello_world/README

	o dispatch/BESDapTransmit.cc: Changes for ticket #1574.
	Refactor using file local class hierarchy to factor out common
	code.

	o Other files: elimination of compiler warnings, mostly
	signed/unsigned and unused parameters.

2010-07-13  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Allow for the multiple inclusion of a file without having it
	loaded twice. This way, module configurations can require
	another module to be loaded before itself. For example, the
	netcdf module can require that the dap module be loaded first.

	Fixed a bug in file inclusion using regular expressions where
	was matching files that started with the file name. So including
	dap.conf would include dap.conf.sav, which would lead to loading
	dap module multiple times.

	Also corrected some compile warnings in keysT and cacheT.

	If the BES needs to exit (Internal Fatal Error) then it was sending the
	error response, and then trying to send an exit to the client. But the
	client wouldn't be listening anymore, it might be trying to send.
	Cleaned this up so that the BES would set the status to error, and set
	exit to true in the chunk extensions. The client should respond
	accordingly.

	Editorial changes to comments; modified www2id() so that it mimics
	the change in libdap

2009-02-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BES Changes: I backed out a change where the CE was run through
	the www2id (un)escaping function. I think the fix for the '&' bug
	is to introduce quoting for the CE words. Fixed some spelling
	errors and updated the www2id() function in BESUtil.cc to match
	the change in libdap's version (the except parameter can now take
	several escape codes).

	When string commands were being passed to the BES it was necessary
	to translate that string using www2id to unescape characters. This
	is not necessary in the XML command request documents as it is
	taken care of by the libxml2 code. For this reason, pass off the
	calling of www2id to the Interface class. In this case, the
	BESCmdInterface class.

	After implementing new xml request documents, the bescmdln
	interactive and -x command line option required the user to input
	xml documents to be sent to the server. This code allows the user
	input the old string commands and have them translated into xml
	documents using libxml2. Moved BESTokenizer from command to
	dispatch so that other utilities could use it. Added
	CmdTranslation to cmdln along with unit tests for it. This allows
	a caller to add translation functions to CmdTranslation similar to
	being able to add commands to the BES. Need to still implement a
	way to allow developers to add commands without modifying the
	code. Perhaps loading a module in like in the BES.

	M    pptcapi-config.in

2008-08-15  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	tcp window tuning is now provided in the tcp connection call. The
	user is allowed to set the tcp window sizes for buffer sizes by
	passing the receive and send buffer sizes to the tcp connection
	call. The system call setsockopt is used to set the buffer sizes
	on the connection socket. If set to 0 then the current buffer
	sizes are used by calling getsockopt.

	Added debugging calls to the code, user can now turn on and turn
	off debugging if desired.

	Fixed the problem where the receive chunk size is bigger than the
	receive buffer size while creating a static buffer to use in the
	receive calls. This will eliminate fragmentation caused by
	allocating new buffers for each call to receive.

	Updated to use 7 characters for chunk length. Fixed problem where
	receive was using a buffer too small in the call to read. The
	buffer is now dynamically created depending on the chunk size.
	Updated the test results because problem fixed in BES data
	handlers where ancillary data wasn't being read. Modified the send
	and receive code to use macro definitions of the chunk so that all
	we have to do is change the macro definitions in pptcapi.h and
	won't have to go through the code to update (except in
	pptcapi_send where building the chunk header).

2008-01-25  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	New exception/error processing and responses have been added to the
	BES.  Instead of many different inherited classes of BESException
	there is now the BESError class with the inherited classes
	BESInternalFatalError, BESInternalError, BESSyntaxUserError,
	BESForbiddenError, and BESNotFoundError. If the fatal error is
	thrown then the BES will exit. Check the BESError class for the
	error type numbers. The errors no longer have context information,
	as it was deemed unnecisary. The XML document returned will have the
	tag <BESError> instead of <BESException>. Please see the trac
	documentation for more information.

	Also in this check in is new symbolic link functionality. In the BES
	configuration file are the new parameters
	BES.*.FollowSymLinks=No|Yes If set to yes, then container and
	catalog requests will follow symbolic links relative to the document
	root. If set to no, then we won't follow symbolic links.

	Set container calls will throw an exception now if the container is
	not valid, does not exist, contains a symbolic link in the relative
	path to the document root if FollowSymLinks is set to no.

	Show catalog requests of collections will return the contents of the
	collection in alphabetical order.

	1. Changed besctl script to check for the BES command line options.
	Any changes here need to be made in daemon.cc and ServerApp.cc as
	well. If the -i option is NOT passed to the script then we set -i to
	be the prefix used when running configure and pass it on to the
	daemon. If the -c option is NOT passed to the script then we set -c
	to be the -i option if specified plus /etc/bes/bes.conf, or to the
	BES_CONF environment variable.

	2. Updated BESServerUtils::show_usage to include the -i options,
	specifying the BES installation directory.

	3. Updated ServerApp.cc to look for the configuration file in -c
	location, then BES_CONF location, then in the directories
	/user/local/etc/bes/bes.conf, then /etc/bes/bes.conf, then
	/usr/etc/bes/bes.conf.

	4. Updated daemon.cc to use the -i option to look for the listener
	executable and the pid file (already doing this). If -i not specified
	then use the path to the daemon executable from argv[0]. If no path
	then look in the current working directory.

	5. Updated server/Makefile.am to not pass any -D options when
	building. This cleans up the package build targets.

	No longer using BES_CONF_DIR variable from Makefile to determine

	BES_CONF environment variable if set, and finally checks for
	/usr/local/etc/bes/bes.conf and then /etc/bes/bes.conf.

	templates/bes.conf, moved the help information to the bottom with a

	templates/RequestHandler.cc, the contents of the file need to be
	wrapped in a tag. dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in, the help parameters for

	bes: Addd hyrax control script

2007-10-25  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	TypeMatch checking now checks the full path of the file/directory,
	not just the basename. This way we can use path checking in the
	regular expressions for handlers such as jgofs, where data files do
	not have an extension. Also checking for an exact match rather than
	just partial match or more.

	Corrected the bes.conf file TypeMatch example.

	Multiple catalogs now works. If there is more than one catalog
	registered then the request must include the name of the catalog
	followed by a colon. For example: show catalog for "nc_catalog:/"; If
	there is only one catalog then works as before.

	Modifications to be able to write all response objects out to ostream
	rather than stdout. Beginnings of chunking. Modified unit tests and
	added new ones to test the funcionality. In PPT making sure that
	handshaking at beginning of connection is done directly to socket
	instead of using send and receive methods on PPTConnection, which
	will be changed to do chunking. The handshaking will NOT do chunking
	but will simply be tokens.

	I moved the test directory to unit-tests and made the tests
	optional - people have to cd to the unit-tests directory to run
	them. This eliminates problems with the distcheck target, even

	M    BESSetContextCommand.cc

2007-04-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Setting READLINE_LIBS instead of changing LIBS. The readline macro
	also checks for a termcap (or ncurses or curses) and adds it to
	READLINE_LIBS. So we don't need a separate check for termcap.

2007-04-10  jgarcia

	Added code to deal with the case when the connect call returns
	zero meaning that the socket is indeed connected immediately even
	in the case of non-blocking sockets. This behavior is observed in
	Solaris 10 but not in Mac OS X and Linux where those kernels are
	implemented in such way that connect *typically* return s-1 which
	means that you must complete the connect call by a select call.

2007-04-06  szednik

	Added call to PPTClient* client shutdown and destructor methods
	prior to calling exit( ) in CmdApp.cc SIGPIPE handler.

2007-04-05  szednik

	modified string copy from _tempSocket and _serverSocket to use
	strncpy( ) and to only copy a string the size of the path opposed
	to a static length.

2007-04-05  szednik

	Updated the connect( ) method of TcpSocket to immediately check
	whether a socket is fully connected. The socket is set to
	non-blocking prior to calling connect(2). connect(2) returns
	EINPROGRESS if the socket is not yet fully connected. select(2)
	and getsockopt(2) are used with a 5 second timeout to test for a
	completed full connection. If a full connection is established
	_connected is set to true, else a SocketException is thrown.
	Before exit of method the socket is returned to its original
	blocking mode.

2007-04-05  jgarcia

	Fixed ticket 885

	Added guards and make the buffer size a define in order to use in
	the implementation file.

2007-04-04  jgarcia

	Fixed memory leak in receive, see ticket 879. Probably it will be
	better to use an BESAutoPtr to deal with how to delete the memory
	in those cases when exceptions are thrown.

2007-04-04  szednik

	Modified the PPTClient constructor that uses a TCP Socket to set
	_connected to the result of a _mySock->isConnected() check rather
	then just to true.

	Updated and changed the names of some of the documents available for
	the BES. Added a document for the BES configuration information that
	can be referenced by all the other documents.

	Added the hello_world module example under the bes so that people
	can see how one could write a module. Another example would be a new
	data handler module that reads csv files.

	Added the installation of the besCreateModule script that creates a
	module.  The templates directory is used by the besCreateModule
	script. These files are installed in the share/bes/templates
	directory.

	Updated the version number for the next beta release.

	Updated some of the comments in the bes.conf.in file.

2007-02-07  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Added information about configuring the BES in the bes.conf file,
	about how to start and stop the BES, and a note about what it means
	to stop the BES, that only the main listener and the daemon are
	stopped. Any listeners currently connected to clients will not be
	stopped in multiple mode.
	M    INSTALL

2007-02-07  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Added the commands 'set context <name> to <value>;' and 'show
	context;'. The first command allows the client to set a context in
	the BES. The reason for this is to allow errors to be dumped back as
	dap2 errors, so the caommand would be 'set context errors to dap2;'.
	The show command will respond with the list of context name/value
	pairs currently set in the BES.

	Modified the Exception classes to contain return codes, instead of
	having these used around the code. Also, a context is set within the
	exception classes. This cleans up the BESExceptionManager. Instead
	of trying to dynamically cast the exception classes to see which one
	it is to set the context and return the correct return code, it's
	all in the exception class.  This way, users can create new
	BESException classes without adding exception callbacks.

	Created a new dap handler exception that contains Error class
	inforamtion, including the ErrorCode. The BESDapModule now adds an
	exception callback to handle the specific case where the error
	context is set to dap2. When this happens an Error object is created
	and dumped to stdout.

	Formatting changes to random source files;
	dispatch/Makefile.am: Modified the value of BES_CONF_DIR
	so that it includes the 'bes' subdirectory. This is a fix
	for #759

	Flushed out a bit more of the secure server development using ssl.
	The paths to the certificate and key file is specified in the bes
	configuration file.  Can also specify what secure port to use in the
	server, defaults to 10003.  Changed debugging in the SSL classes to
	use BESDEBUG.

	Fixed the issue in the Filter transmitter (the transmitter that uses
	a dods filter) where the static send functions were not being
	registered. Only the send_html and send_text methods are on a
	transmitter. All other transmit functions are registered static
	functions for the transmission of other respoonse objects.

	Also modified the response objects for DAS, DDS, and DataDDS to dump
	the actual DAS, DDS, and DataDDS objects in the dump method and not
	just pointers to the objects.

	Also fixed an issue where if a transmitter is not registered to
	transmit a given response object, nothing was happening. If there
	isn't a registered transmit function then an exception is thrown.

2006-12-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESDDXResponseHandler.cc: Fixed ticket 753. Attributes were
	appearing twice in the DDX. This was do to a failure to
	communicate... Code in BESDDXResquestHandler built the DDX using
	the handler's code to build the DDS and DAS, but in the time
	since this (BESDDXReq...) was written the handlers have all
	been changed so that the DDS already contains attributes. So
	when this code added them, it was adding a second copy. This
	code has been modified to just use the DDS that comes from the
	handler.

2006-12-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes to the formatting for some files in dispatch and
	some new text in the top level README. The formatting changes are
	the result of some subtle changes in my Eclipse settings and
	using spaces instead of tabs (which makes the formatting no
	longer dependent on the tabs setting of any editor).

2006-12-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESDapTransmit.cc: Fixed ticket 710. The code for send_basic_ddx()
	was not trapping the Error objects from DODSFilter::send_ddx()
	and recasting them in a BESException object, hence the unknown
	exception error.

2006-12-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESDDXResponseHandler.cc: Removed call to dump.

2006-12-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	If requesting version then the daemon doesn't try to start the
	listener.  Fixed the problem where if you specify -d and then
	another option without specifying a debug option, then an error is
	displayed and the usage is displayed. The version displayed now uses
	the PACKAGE macros from the config file.

	If the token after "with" in a define command is not c.constraint=
	or c.attributes= where c is the container name from a set command,
	then the parser would crash. The problem was that the result from a

	string::npos.

	Added BES.Data.RootDirectory key to bes configuration file. Before
	anyone was able to look at any file on the system. For example, a
	user could have said 'set container values c,/etc/passwd,txt;define
	d as c;get stream for d;' and gotten back the /etc/passwd file. Now
	a root directory is used to make sure that only the data under the
	root directory is searched.

	All classes in BES now inherit from the same parent, BESObj. BESObj
	has a dump method on it that allows, during debug, for an object's
	state to be dumped (private data members, whatever else). Also on
	the BESObj class is a operator<< method so that you can have an
	object, called obj, and do the following: cout << obj ; Created a
	BESIndent class so that dumps can be indented nicely for easier
	debugging.

	Created a BESDebug class and the beginnings of debug information
	throughout the code. The -d option on the command line client and
	the server (including the besctl script) now work. The options takes
	an argument, either cerr (to dump debug information to cerr) or the
	name of a file where debug information will be sent.

	The -t options on the command line client (and in the PPT client
	code) is now working. Before we accepted the flag, but ignored it.

	In the command line client the usage information is only dumped
	once. And, if version is requested, the usage is NOT dumped after
	the version information is dumped.

	Removed any reference to key/value pairs in the BES configuration
	file that had OPeNDAP at the front and any error messages that
	reference them. They all begin with BES.

2006-11-16  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	The purpose of the initT test program is to make sure that global
	objects are being created in the proper order. Both TheCat and
	TheDog were being initiatlized at level 1. Changed TheCat to be
	initialized at level 2 after TheDog is initialized.

	The function sys_errlist does not exist on all machines. Created a

	Default is that if --with-openssl is NOT specified and cannot be
	found on the system then OpenSSL is not used. If --without-openssl
	is specified then OpenSSL is not used. If either --with-openssl is
	specified, --with-openssl is NOT specified nor is --without-openssl
	and openssl is found then it is used.
	M    bes/conf/openssl.m4

2006-11-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	--without-openssl now works correctly. If --without-openssl is
	specified then openssl is not looked for in the system. If nothing
	is specified when running configure (no --with-openssl or
	--without-openssl) then openssl is looked for. If not found an error
	is reported and the configure fails. If it is found then we
	continue. If --without--openssl is specified, then the ssl classes
	in ppt are not built and the code doing authentication is ifdef'd
	out.

2006-11-03  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Once you get back a module object from the plugin factory it can be

	M    BESModuleApp.cc

2006-11-03  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Changed rem_command to del_command to have it delete the command (if
	not the TermCommand) from the list instead of just returning it and
	requiring the user to delete the command. Moved the container and

2006-11-02  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	The core BES code no longer depends on libdap. Changed the Makfile
	to check if the dap-config script exists. If it does, then build the
	dap_module library and the new library bes-dap. If not, just build
	the dispatch library. Created a new parent class for response
	objects BESResponseObject, which used to be in libdap and called
	DODSResponseObject. Created classes to represent DAS, DDS, DataDDS
	in BES, called BESDASResponse, BESDDSResponse and
	BESDataDDSResponse. Created a dap request handler that handles the
	building of help information for dap requests and version
	information.  Changed the container compression routine to look for
	a list of compression extensions (default gz, bz2, and Z) instead of
	a regular expression. Removed the debug flag from the App class
	until we can get a debug class implemented. Any Error exceptions
	need to be caught in the data handlers and converted to
	BESHandlerException (the non-fatal exception). No Error exceptions
	are caught in the core BES.

	BESHeapManager had a static singleton, so one was being created. The
	constructor was setting the current limit and max limit to 3
	megabytes. So, when a user set the max heap to more than 3 meg, and
	wasn't running bes as root, the bes would fail. Most systems, the
	max is infinate, so that the user can set a max without throwing an
	exception.

	BESPlugin.h: Changed RTLD_GLOBAL to RTLD_LOCAL in th dlopen() call.
	This should prevent symbol clashes between two modules. That is, the

	The transmitter was not being set early enough in the process of
	handling a request. if an exception was thrown then it was possible
	to not have a transmitter set. It's still possible, if an exception
	is thrown during startup, but setting the transmitter to either
	basic or http is being done much sooner. During the build phase it
	is possible to replace the transmitter with one set in the request,
	such as using a 'return as' command in a get.

	The uncompress script now purges the cache directory using a cache
	max size that is passed in. I am using the purge_cache perl routine
	from DODS_Cache.pm in dap-server, with some modifications. The
	configure now looks for gzip, bzip2, and perl and sets them
	correctly in the two scripts bes-uncompress.sh and bes-purge.pl.
	Create .in files to do this and modified the Makefile.am in dispatch
	to generate the two scripts. Modified BESContainer to look for the
	key in bes.conf BES.CacheDir.MaxSize, which defaults to 500 MB, and
	pass that cache size to the uncompress script.

	use the name as specified in the bes configuration file instead of a
	hard-coded name. Changed adding the catalog to first look to see if
	a catalog with the given name has already been added. if it has,

	Default uncompression script for uncompressing compressed data files
	using gzip and bzip2

2006-08-19  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Added ability to uncompress compressed data files by using the
	access method on the BESContainer class, rather than simply calling
	get_real_name, which is what was being called. Call get_real_name to
	simply get the real name of the file, but use access when ready to
	access the file for reading. Added three parameters to the
	configuraiton file. BES.CacheDir specifies where the uncompressed
	files will be stored, default /tmp. BES.Compressed.Extensions is a
	regular expression of the different compressed file types.
	BES.Compressed.Script is the shell command to use to uncompress the
	files, not just gzip or bzip2, but a script that can determine what
	to use to uncompress the files, determine the name of the cached
	file that will be created, uncompress the data file, and echo to
	stdout what the cached file name is.

2006-06-30  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	If a libdap Error exception is caught, instead of throw a plain
	BESException, which will eventually force the server to exit, throw a
	BESHandlerException instead which will not force an exit. The
	BESHandlerException simply reports a problem in the data handler.
	
	M    dispatch/BESInterface.cc

2006-06-30  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	When an exception is caught and the response is built with the
	exception in BESExceptionManager, the response is still for the
	request, even though an exception was thrown. The response then
	needs to be named the same as if the request was successful and no
	exception was thrown. It was being named BESException, but that's
	not the name of the response. The response needs to be named, for
	example, showInfo or setContainer.

	UnixSocket.cc: I removed so debug code, added some comments and

2006-05-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	UnixSocket.cc: Fixed the calls to bind. Each call passed a bad
	value for the size of the sockaddr struct. On OS/X this caused the

	transmission. Removed different PERSISTENCE_INIT macros and
	replaced with one. Added TRANSMITTER_INIT macro

2005-08-22  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	local dependencies on dispatch, ppt and command directories, not
	installed versions

2005-08-19  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	if string not found in find method then string::npos returned, not
	< 0

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	changed template dir and added checks at beginning

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	script and templates to allow someone to build an opendap-g data
	handler

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	adding back

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	need to replace somehow

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	no need to check for the c compiler, only the C++ compiler

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Using new PPT library using sockets and encapsulating the PPT
	calls. This way we can switch in and out different communication
	protocols without changing this code.

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	No longer needing this code

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Completely re-worked PPT to keep it more moduler, more black box,
	so that external code need not know about how to communicate using
	PPT, but the underlying client and server connection code knows
	how to initiate a connection, terminate a connection, transmit
	data with a terminate string, etc...

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Using the new PPT library, much more moduler

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	OPeNDAP Apache module that uses command line interface to parse a
	URL request.

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Implemented command line command syntax in separate library, not
	part of dispatch, so now can implement SOAP interface, or some
	other interface to OPeNDAP-g

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Removed parse methods from response handler making the command
	syntax a separate library in a separate directory, the command
	directory. Removed GetResponseHandler and ShowResponseHandler
	because these weren't really response handlers but just classes to
	parse the commands, which have been moved to OPeNDAPGetCommand and
	OPeNDAPShowCommand in the command directory. Removed most
	variables from DODSDataHandlerInterface and replaced them with a
	map of string-string pairs representing those variables. Each
	request will have a different set of variables needed to execute
	that request. Moved DODSApache and DODSWrapper to an apache
	directory. Also moved DODSParser to the command directory and
	called it OPeNDAPCmdParser. Also changed the aggregation server to
	be like the return mechanism. The aggregation command was changed
	to say "aggregate using <name> by <command>". So now the
	aggregation method looks up the aggregation handler with the given
	name and executes the command against the handler.

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	changed to have keys file passed in to the constructor instead of
	specifying dods ini file

2005-08-01  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	changed aggregation command to be aggregate using <agg_handler> by
	<agg_command>, agg_command wrapped in quotes still

2005-07-13  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	If Verbose key in initialization file was set to no then
	DODSMemoryGlobalArea suspended logging to TheDODSLog but never
	turned it back on, so non-verbose logging also didn't get logged.
	Called the resume method on TheDODSLog to turn logging back on.
	Might want to think about using the general verbose flag for this.

2005-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	moved dods.ini to opendap.ini. Default prefix is $OPENDAP_ROOT, not
	installing headers.

2005-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	default prefix is $OPENDAP_ROOT and header install directory is
	include/opendap-g.

	Made default prefix $OPENDAP_ROOT and header install directory
	include/opendap-g.

2005-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	New documentation. Now have wrapper holding on to encoded url
	string so can ask wrapper for different keyword/value pairs in the
	url, such as username and request.

2005-07-05  Rob Morris <Robert.O.Morris@jpl.nasa.gov>

	Set eol-style to native on all text file in the trunk
