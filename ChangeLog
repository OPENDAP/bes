	* Merge: cvs update -j release-3-1-2 -j release-3-1, the next
	merge should use -j release-3-1-3 -j release-3-1

	* Fixed a bug where bad index variables were used with the
	string::find() functions. Using int, uint32, ..., variables to
	hold the indices breaks on some 64bit machines. The fixed code
	runs OK on Sol 7 (64bit) but the problem did not show up there.
	The problems shows up on alphas. I'm committing these changes and
	they'll be tested on the alpha.

	* configure now uses the new DODS_PROG_PERL test and nph-hdf.in
	uses that value for Perl. This eliminates the old exec perl hack
	which broke on Linux.

	* Fixes for the binary-tar target.

	* The server now registers the file name properly. This ensures

	function and not fail.

	DODS_Dispatch perl class.
