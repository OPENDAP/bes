	Comments and use of std::make_shared<http::url>().

	Ngap file cache (#847)
	This is the culmination of the work on DMR++ caching.

	A memory cache is used by each process to hold DMR++ documents for
	fast reuse.  Timing data shows the memory cache returns hits in
	~100uS. This is backed up by a file cache that can be accessed across
	all the processes on a given host (and across hosts if the file system
	supports NFS - which AWS's EFS does). Timing data shows cache hits for
	the file cache return items in ~1mS. Network access has been
	refactored so that the DMR++ is read from the wire directly into a C++
	string object and this takes about 500mS without the overhead of
	authentication (i.e., in tests where we use OPeNDAP's S3 bucket and do
	not rely on a web service for credentials or 'URL signing').

2023-11-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	File cache (#837)

	This is a simple cache for files. Its API is limited to get(key,
	&item), put(key, filename), del(key), clear(), purge(), and
	initialize(...). For all of these operations, the cache is locked.
	The get() operation returns _item_ with a valid open file descriptor
	to the file that is locked using a shared lock. When item is
	destroyed, the lock is cleared. There is a second version of put()
	that takes/returns a &PutItem that holds an open file descriptor that
	other code can write to. When the PutItem instance is destroyed, the
	fd is closed and the exclusive lock on the file is released. The cache
	is process- and thread-safe.

	This code has the home grown CurlHandlePool removed and the libcurl
	'share' used in its place 

	For this modification, the code that managed the curl handle pool (the
	original code) processed data from 20 requests for 2 variables with
	contiguous storage in 222ms. Removing the 'handle reuse' of the pool
	saw that time change to 351ms.  Using the sharing feature of curl (and
	the blunt force trauma lock functions) and that time becomes 227ms. So
	our self-managed and the libcurl scheme are effectively equal, with
	the latter having some room for better performance if the lock
	functions are improved. jhrg 10/6/23

	Remove use of the curl handle pool.

2023-10-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the defaults for the NGAP module DMR++ cache to false.
	The ngap.conf file explicitly sets the caches to 'true'. Also,
	modified the comments in the DMR++ module to indicate that the
	module uses local caches for the DDS and DAS (DAP2 metadata) but
	that the DMR++ caching in currently done in the NGAP module.

2023-10-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	that into GitHub, etc., but it didn't work.I should have been able to

	modules/hdf5_handler/gctp: C99 compatibility improvements (#775)
	* modules/hdf5_handler/gctp: C99 compatibility improvements
	This change adds additional prototypes to avoid implicit
	function declarations, which will not be supported by future
	compilers by default, resulting in build failures.  Also add a
	missing int type, which future compilers will require, too.
	The additional prototypes revealed that the wrapper function gctp_
	has the wrong signature, which is also fixed in this commit.

	S3 module (#773)
	An 's3 reader' module for the BES. To be used for testing...
	This could also be the basis for a module that provides access to data
	held in S3 in a way that is more general than the current module that relies
	on CMR for the locations of the data files.
	This branch also contains fixes for issues in the 'http' convenience library:
	 * Refactor of CredentialsManager so that load_credentials() is always called
	 * Pass the vector<char> buffer in to the caller so that memory does not go
	out of scope once the function returns. I suspect that rapid_json (and similar
	libraries) depend on the document memory.
	 * We remove the include of rapid json in CurlUtils.h The CurlUtils.h header
	is installed but the rapidjson headers are not. Remove the http_get_as_json()
	function and use the simple http_get() and have the client build JSON however
	they want/can.
	* Removed NgapCredentials since it's not used.

	read from the network. However, the file descriptor was not
	rewound to the start of the file, so the valid response data
	was written starting past the initial position. A reader would see the
	initial part of the temporary file as filled with nulls. This
	error was introduced with RR was rewritten.
	Also refactored the CmrApiTest.cc code since this work overlapped
	the CMR legacy API and I was working on those tests.

	Dmrpp string arrays (#668)
	This commit includes the code in support of HYRAX-653 and includes:
	Code to detect fixed length string arrays and add the relevant information to the dmr++ by adding the element:
	<dmrpp:FixedLengthStringArray string_length="###" pad="null | space"/>
	Support for arrays of fixed length strings stored with either the Contiguous or Chunked layouts.
	Support for arrays of fixed length strings stored in the Compact layout is not yet supported. (But will be soon)
	Arrays of variable ;length strings are not yet supported.
	* Add string handling code/files.
	* Added simple Makefile for hdf5 dev code
	* Reviewed PODAACs array of string issues and made a notes.md file.

	New gdal (#646)
	* Added modules/configured_featres.txt
	This can be used in AT_SKIP_IF() to make our tests sensitive
	to features.
	* Added a 'skip this test' based on a features list to the handler test macros
	And used that for the function module when the server si built w/o
	gdal.
	* Modified ncml handler to skip tests if a feature is not present
	More of a hack, really. This only works for the macros AT_CHECK_ALL_DAP_RESPONSES
	and AT_CHECK_DATADDS_GETDAP but that is good enough for the tests that
	use gdal. I think we should probably change AT_CHECK_ALL_DAP_RESPONSES_WITH_CONSTRAINT
	but I don't know how to test that w/o much more work. Suggest a new ticket.
	* Fixed the tests adnd modified AT_CHECK_ALL_DAP_RESPONSES_WITH_CONSTRAINT
	The AT_CHECK_ALL_DAP_RESPONSES_WITH_CONSTRAINT macro now supports
	skipping tests if a feature is not present.
	* Added conditional bes.conf use to Makefile.am
	There are two different bes.conf files depending on whether gdal
	is present. This is probably not scaleable to O(10) features but
	for one or two it should work OK.
	* Added an experimental gdal_module that encompasses both read and writer
	This will enable the functionality now spread across two modules
	in one, so that we only have to link once to gdal and reducing the
	module count in the process.
	* WIP
	* WIP
	* The reader works
	* Both the reader and writer functions work now.

	Hdf5 fill value (#616)
	Add support for HDF5 fill values to the DMR++ XML files and to the DMR++ Handler
	When fill values were used by HDF5 to eliminate storing 'empty' chunks, the
	DMR++ handler was choking since it was trying to read data from chunks that
	did not exist.
	This change has two parts: build_dmrpp/get_dmrpp now builds DMR++ XML
	files that include information about the fill values, and the DMR++ handler will
	use that information to build the correct data values for those chunks which
	use the fill values.
	There are some cases that are not currently supported such as string variables,
	hdf5 array variables (which are different from 'datasets' (that's an array in DAP)
	and compound variables.

	Sigalarm removal (#617)
	The sigalarm code has been removed.
	Also, the tests for debug_functions have been normalized to
	use the common set of handler macros and two of the tests
	which used to trigger a timeout are now marked as 'xfail'
	since they fail - there are no timeouts in the code on this
	branch.
	I left the 'volatile int bes_timeout' line in BESInterface,
	and the calls to set_bes_timeout() and clear_bes_timeout()
	but only really as placeholders - those don't do anything
	except set the global volatile int 'bes_timeout.'

	Makefile.am was 'cleaning' the testsuite scripts (#611)
	Cleaning these scripts with a parallel make meant that
	in some cases the testsuite script was removed before it
	could be run as per 'clean-local' resulting a failure.
	Since the testsuite script is included in the tar ball,
	I removed it from CLEANFILES in three Makefile.am files.
	This seems to fix the issues with 'make clean --jobs=12'
	failing.

	HYRAX-667, 1. When handling the string attribute in the default 
	option of the HDF5 handler, extra NULL terms are added to the 
	end of the string. This doesn't show in the DAS/DMR output. 
	However, it shows extra NULL terms in the fileout netCDF output. 
	So correct them and also update the fake and NASA testsuite in the 
	fileout netCDF. This is actually a bug-fix rather than cleaning 
	warnings. Since I happen to find when cleaning up the warnings and the fix is easy. So just fix it.

	Esc attr 536 delta (#593)
	Added a new BES key to the hdf5 handler EscapeUTF8Attr (default true)
	When true, use the same escaping scheme for UTF-8 values for attributes
	as for ASCII. If false, allow the UTF-8 values to appear unescaped in
	DAS, DDX and DMR responses. Those values currently cause failures in the
	OLFS when it builds the HTML form from the DMR or DDX (the failure actually
	probably happens in the browser and me be due to the xml character encoding
	we use for the DDX and DMR XML which is ISO-8859-1).
	The tests include a new macro that I'd like to also add to the common
	collection of macros in bes/modules/handler_tests_macros.m4. It provides
	a way to test different bes.conf files against the same bescmd file
	without using multiple .at files. As a bonus, this also shows how to
	'inherit' from a bes.conf file to avoid repeating listings of keys and
	how to avoid the need to build a conf file using configure/Malefile.am.

	Dmrpp string array fix (#587)
	Patch for HYRAX-451 - String Array failure.
	This addresses only the simplest case where we have a String Array
	with one element and no constraint. Other cases will fail. This
	case needs tests. Then we will need to expand the way String
	Arrays are represented in the DMR++ and modify the handler to process
	the various ways string arrays can be encoded.

	It turns out that this is not needed for the  history_json attribute. That was hard to see, but having
	this on have _no effect_ on the operation of that code. See HYRAX-649 for more info
	I also reorganized the tests so there is one testsuite, not two since the time when netcdf4 support
	can be optional has long passed.

	Removed the old netcdf_handlerTest.at in favor of testsuite.at

	More string fixes (#571)
	I found places where string length was potentially misused
	To wit, using "value[value.length() - 1]" will fail if the string
	is empty() (i.e., length() == 0). value[0 - 1] winds up with an
	index that's huge. On CentOS8 this triggers a run-time assert.
	BESUtil has two functions to trim trailing slashes and surrounding double quotes
	(trim_if_trailign_slash() and trim_if_surrounds_quotes()). Both modify the string
	passed by reference. Both are safe for empty strings and should be fast. As a by
	product, I rewrote the BESUtil unit test.
	Rewrote assemblePath and added tests. Found one set of values that fail,

	* Changed how the code links to the dap_module to fix 'non-portable' warnings.
	The code was linking against dap_module.la which becomes dap_module.so

	libdap_module.a. I removed --disable-static. However, the .a archives
	are not part of the RPM, so the install step removes them.

	Regex fix (#555)
	Moving GNURegex in this code to BESRegex
	* For a strict impl of emacs regexes, \r and \n are not part of the . metachar
	and so [[:print:]\r\n]* should be used instead of .* when our baselines need
	to match any char or a newline or a carriage return.
	* Added timing tests to regexT

	Dmrpp lazy eval (#553)
	Added the DMZ class which manages reading the DMR++ XML documents
	The pugixml library is used (in its header-library mode) to parse the DMR++. The
	DMZ isolates the rest of the handler from the XML parsing and implements a limited
	lazy-load feature for the XML. This combined with the 'regex fix' from 14 Oct provides
	substantial performance improvements over previous versions of the DMR++ handler.
	What's missing: Lazy-load of attributes was added, but did not correctly process
	global attributes in all cases and broke tests in the NCML handler when that software
	was used to aggregate datasets that were individually accessed using DMR++. In addition,
	EnumDef and OtherXML elements allowed in the DMR are not processed correctly.

	HYRAX-477, DAP4 doesn't support DAP2 Grid. The code that handles the DAP2 Grid coordinates will cause some DAP4 coordinate variables under different groups to be ignored. So this fix ensure the code NOT to call the code that handles the DAP2 Grid coordiantes for the DAP4 case. Also the newly added refactor code use the is_dap4 flag that was not set in the previous commits. So this fix also corrects set this flag. A new test is added to ensure this case and the NASA file testsuite is also updated.

The original tests that failed because of the enforcement of the data value correctness are updated with the error macro. (3) The corresponding correct netCDF-4 enhanced tests existed in the original tests.

	HYRAX-449, A comprehensive check of datatype match and implementation of ensuring _FillValue attribute type the same as the variable type. This check-in includes: 1. Ensure the DAP4 to fileout netCDF-4 enhanced model data type one to one match for both variables and attributes, including ensuring _FillValue attribute match the variable type. The datatype includes all integer and float types DAP4 support. 2. The implementation that ensures the _FillValue match is largely updated for DAP2 Array 3. The implementation that ensures the _FillValue match is added for DAP4 Array 4. The implementation that ensures the _FillValue match is added for scalar type. 5. Two tests that includes all the integer and float types data(both array and scalar) and the intentionally mismatched _FillValue attribute types are added. The file is an HDF5 file.     It tests     1) the HDF5-CF-DMR to fileout-netCDF4 enhanced model     2) the HDF5-default-DMR to fileout-netCDF4 enhanced model 6. Also correct a few inconsistent datatype mapping between the following cases, mostly for DAP2 and classic model.     1) DAP2 variable to fileout netCDF variable     2) DAP2 attribute of a variable to fileout netCDF attributes of the same variable 7. More tests will be added and code are cleaned up.

	HK-550, fix the memory leaking detected by valgrind

	HK-551, the attrs->append_attr() call changes the attrs in a for loop of attrs iterator. This causes the segmentation fault of when checking the next iterator of the original attrs, which doesn't exist any more. Since the next line of this call writes the attribute to the netCDF file, appending this attribute to attrs is not necessary. So just comment out this line. After fixing this, the program runs and exits normally.

	The sidecar files will now be moved to /tmp when they are generated. The server-side functions will be able to access the sidecar files knowing which directory they will be in. This is sort of a temporary fix until we can think of a better solution.

	It was the 'buffer not divisable by four' bug.

	Partial fix for the contiguous chunk parallel read code.
	Two test still fail. The error was that we used the whole value for the
	child chunk offset when determining where to put a child chunk's data
	into the master chunk. This resulted in writing data far past the end
	of the master chunk's buffer. The correction is to subtract the master
	chunk offset from the child chunk offset. At least, that fixes most of
	the tests.

	For DAP2, both the binary and ascii responses work WRT response limit;

2018-12-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tiny clean up

	Applyied the 'DODS_EXTRA' fix to the DAS.

	Annotation service: Added tests along with a fix for the 'container collision' bug
	Handlers do not generally test to see if an attribute container exists
	before making one, so if the Annotation URL attribute is added to
	DODS_EXTRA and then the handlers are run and one of those handlers
	also uses a container called DODS_EXTRA... libdap throws. My fix is
	to call the handlers first, and then add the attribute. I look for
	DODS_EXTRA and insert the attribute or make the container, as needed.

	Added integration tests for the annotation service url feature
	Some tests fail...

	Added support for the Annotation service the DDS.
	Added a compile-time switch for the annotation service

	Added support for a bes.conf parameter to supply the annotation URL.
	I added this to the BESResponseHandler object. The BESDASResponse
	Handler is modified to use it. No tests for the DAS yet.

	For the unconstrained reads, HTTP 500 errors will be retried.
	This matches Amazon's S3 docs. HTTP 500 errors result in re-tries up to
	10 times, starting with a 1ms delay up to 1s delay.

2018-10-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	When one thread throws an exception, join with the remaining ones.
	This will hopefully prevent resource leaks.

	Fixed use of ostringstream with an initial value.
	If an ostringstream is used with an initial value, the stream state
	std::ios::ate must also be used if new information using << is to be
	appended.

2018-10-04  Cloud User  <centos@ip-172-31-11-224.ec2.internal>

	Fixed the code in DmrppArray that builds errors strings in the threads
	Adding #include <sstream> in BESError.h broke the FreeForm handler. really.

	added a comment to BESError.h

	Minor error in BESError.h - cannot init a stringstream with an int.

2018-10-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added better error reporting to the DMR++ pthreads code
	Now, when a thread signals an error, file and line info is included.
	This remedies the situation where all the errors appear to come from
	the place in the code that reads the thread status info.

	Fixed an error in my pipe-closing code - it was trapping errors
	The curl verbose mode no longer depends on BES verbose logging, which
	makes for more compact logs. Also, trimmed extra newlines from the
	curl debug info.

	Close pipe file descriptors in DmrppArray::read_chunks_unconstrained()
	This may fix a resource leak we see in tests.

	Changed logging of errors
	Added BES.ExitOnInternalError option, If true, the BES will
	exit on an InternalError (default is the current behavior,
	which is to not exit).

	Added BES.DoNotLogSourceFilenames which defaults to false.
	Now BESError's will be logged with the filename and line number
	by default (new behavior).

	Also 'improved' instrumentation in BESFileLockingCache making it
	a bit easier to see what's going on. Still needs work.

2018-10-04  Cloud User  <centos@ip-172-31-11-224.ec2.internal>

	improved error reporting for both curl and in the BES log
	Errors in the BES log now have line numbers in verbose mode.
	Curl now prints 'info' via its verbose mode when the BES log
	is set to verbose and --enable-developer is used for the build.

2018-10-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed BESFileLocking cache so it's easier to track locking of files
	Part of debugging the DMR++ code. It looks like there is an error
	that is leaving files with shared read locks.

2018-09-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for MDS use when DDX responses are constrained with CE functions

	The MDS does not work with server functions.
	When a CE contains a server function call, the MDS should not be used.
	In that case, the MDS will try to build a DDS and evaluate the CE, but
	the type classes in the DDS won't support data read operations, resulting
	in an obscure error about unimplemented read() methods. This commit
	fixes the problem for DDS and DMR responses, but not DDX responses.
	The latter don't appear to handle constrained requests at all.

	Fixing baselines for change to cvs_handler

2018-09-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed an error in the CSV handler's DAS response
	The DAS is simply a 'type' attribute for each variable - the type of
	'type' should be "String" and the value should be the name of the
	datatype (e.g., "Float32"). The DAS incorrectly used the variable's
	type as the type of the 'type' attribute.

2018-09-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Minor modification to BESUtil::get_time() - it can handle longer time zone names
	And returns a valid string if the date/time won't fit in the string
	buffer

	Fix the MDS 'initial_state_hack' for distcheck

	bes/cmdln/tests MDS initial state

	Now cmdln/tests preloads the MDS cache for its tests
	This is a work-around for the cmdln tests, which only run when the BES
	is running. See HYRAX-811. The MDS returns different DAS responses than
	the data handlers, so cached DAS responses will differ from the first
	DAS for any given dataset.

2018-09-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	hdf4/5 modules have matching changes for make install

	make install no longer copies old conf files to date-stamped backups.

	Merge branch 'hyrax-1.15' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into hyrax-1.15

	Changes to HDF4/5 for the DDX baselines are on a branch (also named hyrax-1.15)

2018-09-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified travis.yaml to install/start the bes before running the tests
	This will run the cmdln tests, which test the server and not the
	besstandalone app, which is just a tiny bit different. In this set of
	tests the server is installed and will load all of the modules in
	their default configuration. The besstandalone tool only ever loads a
	subset of the modules and often with 'special' settings.

	Fixes for the bes/cmdln tests - run when the bes is running.
	These baselines should be independent of various run-time parameter.
	If not, then we should swap to the better set of m4 macros and drop
	the use of self-contained ones.

	Revert "checkpoint - flawed version of recursive chunk_offset computation."
	This reverts commit 9dd1c9fc2d5775b3217dcaa35617625f183c54a5.

2018-08-16  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Dropped catalog attribute from node representation.

2018-08-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	checkpoint - flawed version of recursive chunk_offset computation.
	Previous commit works.

2018-08-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Optimization: remove repeated calls to DmrppArray::get_shape()

	Updates to DmrppArray and to the tests.
	DmrppArray::read_chunk_unconstrained() minor fix - insert_chunk_unconstrained()
	failed to call itself and called insert_chunk() instead.
	I added tests that read from a local AIRS granule that I 'shrunk'
	using h5copy. These tests help with profiling (and include reading
	from an essentially equivalent file in S3).

	I think I've fixed the renaminng issue when data are requested.
	The baselines were wrong for this branch when data were requested.
	While the metadata requests were correct when variables were
	renamed, the data responses used the old variable names. Fixed.
	I also fixed the issue where a Grid aggregation was returning
	a Structure (405 and maybe test 406). I have not updated the
	baselines - someone else needs to check them to maek sure I'm
	not deluded...

	type, and not the attribute's length (as returned by the nc_att_inq()
	function.

2018-08-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix to testsuite.at - fixed unbalanced parens in AT_INIT.

	Replaced DDS::add_var and Aray::add_var with add_var_nocopy in many places.
	I did not replace the calls to NCMLParser::addCopyOfVariableAtCurrentScope()
	since that seemed more intricate than I wanted to as part of this
	bug fix - especailly since I have not actually fixed the real bug,
	just patched it. ...Although the patch is more efficient thatn the
	original.

	Added comments and switched to add_var_nocopy() for Grids.

	Fixes for HYRAX-803 - these changes patch a memory error flagged by ASAN.
	The problem appears to be in the copy constructor(s) for the two classes
	ArrayAggregateOnOuterDimension and ArrayAggreagtionBase or is a latent
	problem they trigger (although those methods are so thin it's hard
	to imagine them being broken). Regardless, replacing the DDS::add_var()
	calls with DDS::add_var_nocopy() calls fixes the errors. See the bug
	report for an extensive discussion of the errors.

	Also tweaked the dispatch tests in a minor way - no change to
	their overall behavior. The test 'banner' is now more verbose.

	Merge pull request #174 from OPENDAP/agg_rename
	Agg rename

	Added **/bes.conf to git ignore at the top level.
	[skip ci]

	Fixed ticket HYRAX-802.
	We were pretty close with our 'send_p' hack, but there was one wrinkle -
	the send_p flag has to be cleared after the data are read in case a CE
	is then applied. Failure to do so leaves the CE parser thinking it's
	working on a variable that has already been constrained. That's OK,
	but only in limited cases.
	I also modified the tests/Makefile.am so that TESTSUITEFLAGS env var
	works (it was overridden in the Makefile).

2018-08-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Found and fixed a memory access error in netcdf_handler
	The handler did not correctly process Attribtues that
	were enumerations. Oddly, it appears that _FillValue
	is also an enumeration in the test files. Baselines
	not yet updated.

	Added AIRS complete file access bescmd files.

	Problems with read_chunked_unconstrained() fixed.

	Added more scripts; read_chunks_unconstrained has problems

	I modified how variables are renamed - now only tests 97 101 fail
	The code only renames the inner Array of a Grid (by explicitly
	testing for the the dods_grid_c value from BaseType::type()).
	I also replaced the test that used dynamic_cast<Array*> to use
	...type() != dods_array_c.

	Refactored out the awkward singleton pattern from BESCatalogUtils.
	Instances are held by BESCatalogs, which are themselves held in a
	singleton list - so by extension BESCatalogs and ...Utils are
	singletons. I also found that BESCatalogUtils::get_handler_name() was
	never used, but could have been in several places. I replaced that code
	with calls to get_handler_name().

	Merge branch 'master' into mds_xml_base
	Conflicts: dap/GlobalMetadataStore.cc

	Resolved the missing xml:base issue.
	If the BES contxt xml:base is missing do not throw an exception
	or use a default value. Instead, do nothing WRT the xml:base
	attribute. If the attribute was present when the response was
	added to the store, that value wil be present when it is extracted.
	If no value was present, there will be no value in the response
	that is returned.

	The OLFS should _never_ call the BES without setting the xml:base
	context, so all responses from teh MDS should have this attribute.

	Added use of xml:base context to read the value od xml:base
	And added tests

	Added tests for the new insert_xml_base() function
	This function is used by the MDS to correct the value or xml:base
	in DMR/++ responses based on the value sent over by the OLFS.

	controls if the Dap4ResponseHandler and DataResponseHandler look for DMR++
	responses at all (if they are never going to be present, there's no
	point in locking the MDS to look for them). The key BES.Dmrpp.Name is
	used to make sure when the response handler code re-directs the request
	to the DMR++ handler, is uses the name used in the DMR++ handler's conf
	file.

2018-06-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added tests for the DMR++ changes to the BES framework and DMR++ handler.
	Only one file, but the changes to the framework, such that a file with
	a DMR++ response in the MDS is redirected to the DMR++ handler, clearly
	work. More tests won't prove much, but the change should use a bes.conf
	key to disable the redirection since it will access the MDS and if an
	admin knows the DMR++ is not being used, why do that for every request?

2018-06-01  Kodi Neumiller  <kodi@Udays-MacBook-Pro.local>

	A bit more refactoring on this problem

2018-05-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added redirection to the DMR++ handler for data requests when that's appropriate
	The DAP2 and DAP4 data requests look in the MDS for DMR++ responses
	that match the relative path of the current container. If one is
	found, the container type is set to dmrpp and container attributes
	are set so that the DMR++ handler will realize that it should look
	in the MDS for a DMR++ response (normally it uses the value of access()
	to find a DMR++ file on disk).

	Still to do: implement the DAP2 code in the DMR++ handler and tests.

2018-05-31  Kodi Neumiller  <kodi@Udays-MacBook-Pro.local>

	HYRAX-747. Added HDF5 files for tests

2018-05-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	checkpoint. build_dmrpp cannot write the response to the MDS cache
	But it does read the DMR response _from_ the cache.

	checkpoint. see ticket 663

2018-05-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added #include <typeinfo> to DmrppMetadataStore.cc

	Tested: Using the Global M S to read a DMR++ written using Dmrpp M S.
	See DmrppMetadataStoreTest::use_dmrpp_response_test().

	Fixed the 'ledger issue' where the ledger was private in Global M S
	The larger 'ledger issue' (that it should be protected at write
	time) I left for later.

	Merge branch 'master' into dmrpp_mds

	Added test for get_dmrpp_object()

	Added more of the Dmrpp Interface (by adding methods to Global MS).
	Also trimmed away unneeded includes in the Dmrpp MS implementation.

	MDSReadLock change to enable easy(ier) specialization of the MDS.
	Also, refactored the get_dds_response(), ..., methods; they are
	called write_dds_response(), etc., as suggested by Nathan.

2018-05-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed seg fault in build_dmrpp when -d option is used.
	Note that now there is output with -d only when -v (verbose)
	is used too. The -d option was more of a testing/developement
	tool, but it should be working.

	Remove bes.conf and bes.log in modules/dmrpp_module/unit-tests/ to fix distcheck

	Added input-files to modules/dmrpp_module/unit-tests/Makefile.am

	Some cleanup

2018-05-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified build_dmrpp so that it uses the fullnamepath attribute
	...and so that it ignores variables that cannot be found in the HDF5
	file if that attribute is not present - assuming this indicates a
	virtual variable. This fixes the bug described in HYRAX-756 - where
	get_dmrpp.sh fails for datasets with non-root group variables.

	It does not address another problem, however, that some variables
	don't have values even though they show up in the DAP data set when
	using the HDF5 handler's CF compatibility mode. I added a story about
	that (HYRAX 761).

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master'

2018-05-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for finding compression filters for a given hdf5 dataset.

	Added support for the href/url info.
	I made this a different param from the hdf5 file name since the file
	might be in temp storage while we read its info but the data actaully
	will be read from another location (like S3).

	Added support for finding the chunk dimension sizes.

	Use the default value for print_chunks in the call to DMRpp::print_dmrpp()

	Fixed: DmrppCommon::print_dap4() --> ... print_dmrpp().
	The name print_dmrpp() is better for the DmrppCommon class' method.

	Comments, some loose ends with the print code in dmrpp_module
	I made the DMR++ namespace and namespace prefix static class
	fields of DmrppCommon. This way we can change the default prefix
	using a parameter in the module's conf file.

	checkpoint. What is here, works. The tests pass.
	The CLI tool build_dmrpp will print a DMR++ with chunk info, where the
	chunk info is read using the HDF5 API. Inputs are an HDF5 file and
	a (plain) DMR. The result is a DMR++. The handler has the capability
	to print/return _either_ a DMR or DMR++ depending on the value of
	the class static bool dmrpp::DmrppCommon::d_print_chunks, which
	defaults to false. Yes, I know. A global. An alternative would be
	to load up the Dmrpp<Type> objects with chunk info, and then insert
	the corresponding elements into the DMR DOM tree. Version 2?

	Fixed the DmrppCommonTest baselines

	checkpoint. Added unit tests for DmrppCommon, incl print_dmrpp()
	Have not added the baselines yet, however.

	checkpoint. In dmrpp_module: make check works; build_dmrpp inches forward.

	build_dmrpp can now use the variables in a DMR to get names of a HDF5 datasets.

2018-05-08  Corey Hemphill  <hemphilc@oregonstate.edu>

	Merge pull request #37 from RiverHendriksen/bes-covjson-issue-x
	Checking in many major changes to transform. Transform now behaves more dynamically, and instead of just reading and printing at once, the module reads, stores, and then prints everything at the same time. This is a fundamentally different approach than what we were originally doing. Also added extended logic for defining domain type, and extended logic determining CoverageCollection and printing appropriately.

	Look at the code in dmrpp_module/unit-tests/DmrppParserTest.cc to
	see a newer version of 'get the chunk info' software than I used
	to make the data/build_dmrpp util. Same basic idea, but the ParserTest
	code is newer. Start there.

	Added build_dmrpp.cc to the dmrpp_module/data/ directory.
	This is a simple command line utility that prints storage information
	about a single hdf5 dataset (aka variable). It needs quite a bit more
	work to process all the information in a whole hdf5 file.

2018-03-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	MDS remove_responses() is now conditional on SYMETRIC_ADD_RESPONSES
	If defined, the method returns true when all the responses are
	removed, otherwise it returns true if any of the responses are
	removed.

	Minor change - MDS remove_responses() now considers removing anything to be a success
	This mirrors the behavior that says if the code is writing only DAP2
	given a DDS or DAP4 given a DMR, be relaxed about what you delete for
	a given name.

	checkpoint - test mostly work but the MDS remove_responses() is broken
	The SYMETRIC_ADD_RESPONSES change breaks remove_responses().

	Merge pull request #123 from OPENDAP/travis
	Travis

	Changed how the MDS stores the responses.
	Now the MDS only stores DDS and DAS responses built using the DDS
	and DMR responses built using the DMR. This is different from the
	old behavior where all three metadata responses were built using
	eitehr the DDS or the DMR.

	Change the CI build to use aws S3 to store the test results.

	Update to a MDS test baseline to accommodate libdap changes
	Also, an update to travis.yml to use curl to read the binary
	dependencies instead of the aws cli. This means that future
	pull requests from forks will work (as we learned with libdap,
	PRs from a fork don't run under our UID and don't have access to
	encrypted env vars and, thus, cannot use the aws cli, even with
	a globally read-able S3 bucket).

	Modified a das file used with the dapreader tests.
	This DAS response should match the response returned by the new
	version of DDS:print_das() in libdap.

2018-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes to two baselines
	Also added some code (not used yet) to support constrained DMR responses
	using the MDS. Lets fix the current crop of bugs first. (HYRAX-648)

2018-03-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Dropped back to regular logging for the MDS tests. Easier to read...

	DDS adn DAS now use the MDS cache/store. There are some problems, however.

	checkpoint - remove MDS tests (2) that fail so I can test distcheck

	checkpoint - added is_{dds,das}_available() methods to the MDS.

	Added comments about the MDSReadLock object and LOG() use by is_dmr_available().

2018-03-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More updates - added LOG() calls for cache hits and misses.

	Two tests fail in dapreader when using the MDS, 61 and 62.
	The error is a seg fault.

	checkpoint - Fixes for the DHI container logic. Tests mostly pass

	checkpoint - adding some tests.

	Checkpoint - DMR implemented; needs testing along with the MDS changes

	Added nodes to the site maps
	If the (new) parameter node_suffix is not the empty string, print
	information about nodes. If the leaf_suffix param is not empty,
	print information about leaves. This is a new behavior for the

	The data dir in xmlcommand/tests can now be deleted when running distcheck
	The problem was that data was copied from the source tree, which is
	write protected. To delete it, I had to add a call to chmod. Done.

	Site map

	Tests pass distcheck on my host
	I dropped the CatalogDirectory get_site_map_test_2 () because its
	too dependent on what distcheck packs into the tar ball

	Fixed tests for get_site_map.
	I realized that I needed to use different catalogs for the different
	tests because the CatalogUtils objects are singletons and do not
	'pick up' new valus for the keys. Thus, changing the value for a
	catalog by editing the keys will show up in the catalog object, but
	not the (singleton) Utils object. ...no idea why the Utils are singletons.

	Added <memory> to dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.cc

	Added a test for BESCatalog::get_site_map()
	This is a pretty primitive method - but the basics are here. This
	could be used by a command, could build a BESInfo object or could
	feed information to something that could build a BESInfo response.

	tar copies the file/dir linked to, not the link itself. So
	tests that should fail because the BES should not, as part
	of the test, follow sym links will not fail because the 'link'
	is not actaully a link anymore.

	Added a comment

	Started removing unused parameters and simplifying methods

	is where all generated files go and the bes.conf is a generated

	Log fixes

	Switched to ISO8601 date-time; UTC is the default.
	People can use lcal time in the logs using BES.LogTimeLocal in bes.conf.
	The old date format is still in the code and can be used by #undef the
	the compile-time switch ISO8601_TIME_IN_LOGS.

2017-11-15  udayopen  <ukari@opendap.org>

	HYRAX-548: introduce copytruncate directive in besd.logrotate, remove brute-force stop/start

2017-11-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Log only one line per get command.
	This can be switched back to the 'three-lines-per-get' mode. Here's more
	information about these changes:

	* Look in BESXMLInteface.cc for the define that controls the
	  three-line or on-line versions (LOG_ONLY_GET_COMMANDS).

	* Look in BESLog.h for a define that will enable tracing the LOG and
	  VERBOSE macros use (TRACE_LOGGING).

	* Look in BESExceptionManager.cc at log_error() for massive hacks to
	  that method, including my decision to log all errors in both verbose
	  and regular modes.

2017-11-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	A little debugging/instrumentation

	Much better logging. Verbose is verbose, !verbose is not.
	The regular logging could be more concise, but that's for tomorrow.
	Also added, a way to trace where in the code log info is written.

	Logging improved...

2017-11-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Massive attempt to fix the logging of the BES. Somewhat successful...
	Still a work in progress.

	Minr edits to the calls to finish()

	Added comments and removed #if 0 ... #endif blocks.

	Minor tweaks
	To run correctly, the BES needs to set the error return info in the
	chunking code _before_ it calls the internal error processig software.
	At least, it seems that way.

2017-11-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Remove the odd finish_with_error() method.

2017-11-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge pull request #87 from OPENDAP/command-refactor
	Command refactor

	Fixed a glictch in the error returns that broke the olfs end-to-end regression tests

2017-11-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More refactoring - BESInterface/XMLInterface is now ready for changes.
	I updated some other parts of the code: Switched to the LOG() macro
	and change the show catalog test to a more reliable dir and baseline.
	The latter will simplify these kinds of refactoring changes since I can
	run the cmdln tests against a running BES more easily.

	More hackery - working on logging issues.

	Remove transmit_data()?

	Added one comment
	Move transmit_data() into execute_data_request_plan()

	Cleaned up #if ... #endif and removed the unused Reporter feature

2017-11-08  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More movement of functionality to BESXMLInterface.

	More refactoring - moved more functionality into BESXMLInterface from BESInterface

2017-11-08  ndp-opendap  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Fixed LMT problem in ShowPathInfo. Now sending milliseconds since epoch

2017-11-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removing the invoke_aggregation() code - it's not used anymore.
	There's a fair amount support for aggregation in the define command
	as well, but that's another deal for another day.

	Starting to factor BESInterface out and/or reduce its size.

	Refactoring the command processing software.
	The first part of this refactoring is to streamline the BESInterface
	and BESXMLInterface classes and to understand how the DataHandlerInterface
	object is manipulated.

2017-11-03  ndp-opendap  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Working on refining ShowPathInfo response content model and content consistency

2017-11-02  ndp-opendap  <ndp@opendap.org>

	This is an attempt to get the CI build to work.

	Adding the keepalive2 program to the list of ignored files

2017-11-01  ndp-opendap  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Dropped production built file

	Merge branch 'bes-show-path-info' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into bes-show-path-info

2017-11-01  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added new ShowPathInfoTest

2017-11-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed double quotes on AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS's value
	I think this was breaking the distcheck build.

	I wonder about dropping the parts of the build and just running
	distcheck. That would be faster... Or configuring our build to run
	two builds in parallel.

	Minor edits to tests Makefile.am files in hello_world and functions

2017-10-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Found the likely problem with hello_world and distcheck.
	Symptom: distcheck seems to be putting generated files in
	the srcdir and not builddir - this includes things like
	bes.conf. The problem was (maybe - we'll see how far the
	build gets) that hello_world (the directory) was included
	in a parent Makefile.am's EXTRA_DIST and having generated
	files included in the distribution means they are put in
	$srcdir and not $builddir. And apparently including a dir
	in EXTRA_DIST means put everything in the dist, even if
	that dir has a Makefile.am.

2017-10-31  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added suffix deconstruction

2017-10-30  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Updated modules on master

2017-10-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed unused Get DataDDX XML Command; edits to comments

2017-10-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the way the bes log string is built.
	I'm not actually sure this string is needed; could the information be
	written to the log directly? Does it need predicates like 'as', 'for',
	and 'in?'

	Checkpoint - refactoring the Interface, XMLCommand classes.
	Removed unused fields, renamed confusng fields, removed unused formal
	parameters.

2017-10-22  ndp-opendap  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Moved the ShowPatInfo from w10n_module to xmlcommand. Moved the ShowPathInfoResponseHandler to dap. Migrated w10n_module to used new ShowPathInfo* Moved w10n_module ShowPathInfo code to unused die.

2017-10-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Formatting for BESInterface and BESXMLCommand
	[skip ci]

2017-10-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge pull request #84 from OPENDAP/cmdln-tests
	Cmdln tests

	Figured out how to implement 'check' in bes/cmdln/tests
	This version of check-local runs the tests if a BES is found,
	just prints an innocuous message if it is not found.

	Fixed the integration tests in bes/cmdln

	Added --baselines option to besTest; fixed one test

	Fixed some bescmd files for the cmdln tests. Fewer tests fail...

	Fixed the formatting of some files.
	[skip ci]

2017-10-19  jgallagher59701  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More changes for distcheck with dmrpp_module.
	There seem to be issues in the hello_world sample handler.

	Updated tests in cmdln for ubuntu
	The size and count xml attrs are no longer recored
	in the 'show' command baselines so that values that
	differ for different file systems and test configs
	won't cause false failures.

2017-10-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added -lz to the link of the dmr++ unit tests - for ubuntu.

	Fixed a typo in the dmrpp_module Makefile.am

	Changes to build on Travis using --enable-developer.

2017-10-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed config tests of dmrpp_module/test
	This was casuing distcheck to fail

2017-10-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed dmrpp_handler/tests configure files.
	We dropped these tests since they did nothing.

2017-10-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed dist; retired old code

	Now dmrpp_handler is built only when configure is run using --enable-developer
	This makes it easier to keep this code on the master branch
	and avoid having it 'age.'

	Merge branch 'master' into dmr++
	Conflicts: xmlcommand/BESXMLInterface.cc

2017-10-25  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added BES dap_module to libs so the dmrpp code can use it

	Merge branch 'master' into dir_cleanup

	Updated hdf4 and 5 handler submodule commit hashes

	Massive changes - I re-worked the DAP_MODULES conditional build
	DAP_MODULES --> DAP_BUILTIN_MODULES and is now olny used in the
	main bes Makefile.am. The builtin modules only work as such. The
	DAP_EXP_MODULES symbol/conditional is reserved for the future.
	I modified the hdf4/5 modules minimally, but had to update the
	symbol name in their code.

	Various fixes for distcheck, mostly because I added hello_world to the build

	Added stuff to modules/data
	Information about all of the data files we currently have in the
	various handlers. Not perfectly clean, but a decent synopsis.

	Added two bescmd file to modules/fileout_gdal to test geotiff output
	I have not wired these up yet, so they are 'unused' tests. Maybe once

	the case, but it's pretty good (it will not bind them to shared dims).
	The DMR is correct and build from DMR/DAP4 API calls except for the
	attributes which are made using DAP2 AttrTable objects that are transformed
	to DAP4 attributes.

	Clean up residual cache code. Add a note about fcntl(2) versus flock(2)
	Both fcntl(2) and flock(2) can be used for advisory locking. The
	BESFileLockingCache uses fcntl() and that impacts testing since
	all of our testing is single-process. Not a huge deal, but if we
	want more complete testing we'll need to change how we implement

	Fix to BESFSDir for the opendir/readdir race condition.
	When two processes are using the same directory and one process makes
	and deletes files in the directory at the same time as the other
	process uses opendir/readdir to iterate over the files in the
	directory, it's possible for file names to show up in entries returned
	by readdir that no longer exist (i.e., stat(2) returns -1). It's better
	to ignore this than signal an error (IMHO).

	Added comment to ContainerStorageVolatile about needing BESKeys file

	pvolT now uses separate tests.
	I'm not sure this really addresses the underlying issue with the pvolT
	and keysT conflict, but is makes the test cleaner and might help debug

	Unit tests in dispatch fail when run in parallel. This is a fix.
	The setup() code in pvolT seems to conflict with the code in keysT
	when keysT starts and then pvolT starts and finishes before keysT
	finishes. I have no idea why, but the text in the pvolT's setup()
	shows up in keysT. It turns out that the setup() code is not needed,
	and removing it seems to fix the problem. Seems to...

2017-01-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for an errant test in H4ByteStream::read()
	The code was testing if the correct number of bytes were read, but
	then we added support for compressed chunks. Because the test was made
	on the read buffer size _after_ the dat were decompressed, it failed
	since the bytes in the buffer were larger than the bytes read off
	disk. I moved the test so it's before the call to decompress the data,
	and the test now passes. Unresolved is the issue of just what the
	d_bytes_read field means - is it the # of bytes read from disk or the
	number of bytes in the buffer. I have left it at the latter.

	Fixed bug in DmrppArray where H4ByteStream::read() was called incorrectly.
	The number of elements was used in place of the number of bytes. Fixed.

	Added support and tests for compressed chunks.
	This code handles onlt gzipped chunks (not shuffled + gzipped). That
	will have to come later...

	Repairs for netcdf and hdf5 builds
	The hdf5 library now uses libdl and that has to be used when
	calling autoconf's CHECK_LIB (for both netcdf4 and HDF5). This
	broke the HDF5 handker (and the netcdf handler on CentOS 7).

2016-06-08  Cloud User  <centos@ip-172-31-39-143.ec2.internal>

	HDF5 needs libdl and so netcdf4 also needs libdl
	The configure script was not finding netcdf on CentOS 7. I think this
	will be an issue elsewhere but it has not shown up because not all of
	the deps code has been updated to the newer HDF5 library.

	BESDapResponseCache works!
	This code uses a specialization of Sequence (CachedSequence) that
	reads values, row by row, from the object's own internal data.
	It uses the Sequence::serailize() and intern_data() implementations
	so that nested sequences are sipported. The specialization of
	Sequence might also serve as a replacement to the TabularSequence
	code in bes/functions.

2016-05-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed error serializing Sequence data read from ResponseCache
	Needs more testing, but what I did was to specialize
	Sequence::read_row() so that it would read values from the Seqeuence
	internal data (d_values) and then feed that into the serailize()
	methods.

2015-11-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hacked BESDapResponseBuilder.cc so functions returning structures work
	A test hack: If we see that a server function has returned a Structure,
	assume that it should be 'flattened' and do so. This means that the
	ugrid() subsetting function can return its multiple variables and the
	client will see that as such and not a Structure with N fields. This
	preserves the look of the source dataset. We'll have to think about
	this hack and how best to really implement it. The code could be faster
	(using fewer/no copies) and could be less prone to failure (it assumes
	every Structure returned by a function should be flattened). Not
	insurmountable problems...

	Coverity fixes

2015-10-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' into coverity_scan

	Update to hdf5_handler
	New basline for test 257 - just updated libdap for this.

	Removed force of libdap 3.16 rebuild

	started second CI build before first stopped and libdap never got cached

	Remove forced rebuild of libdap
	ci-skip

	Force rebuild of libdap 3.16.0
	...instead of having Travis pull the current 3.16 code from
	its cache.

	Borked TheBESKeys.h - Undone.
	I'm not sure I understand why the BESKeys have this controller object,
	but in trying to plug a leak - that's not really a leak in the
	traditional sense but is a PITA all the same because it complicates
	looking for other leaks - I added a virtual dtor to TheBESKeys and
	that broke things all over the place.

2015-10-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge pull request #11 from OPENDAP/keys_virtual_dtor
	Refactor for BESKeys and TheBESKeys: Added a virtual dtor

	New hdf5_handler fixes for test #257 modified:   modules/hdf5_handler

	update install_bes_source_deps to use libdap 3.16.0

	Modified install_bes_source_deps to rebuild cached deps

2015-10-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Remove function result caching for now.
	Used a compile-time switch FUNCTION_CACHING which is #undef now in
	BESDapResponseBuilder.cc. The fix for this is to rewrite DapResponse
	Builder.cc/h and come up with a better function result caching scheme.

	Still fails unit tests in dap/unit-tests
	The server function fails on it's initial call when the value has not been cached.

	Updated gitignore

	Make a local cache dir for the tests in bes/functions/tests

2015-10-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	NCML module update

	Refactor for BESKeys and TheBESKeys: Added a virtual dtor
	I also changed how BESKeys *TheBESKeys::TheKeys() was written so
	that the static class variable TheBESKeys::ConfigFile is set
	when a bes.conf file is found in one of the etc dirs.

	Updates to hd4 and ncml handlers
	ncml: Fixed the evil HR-64 bug
	hdf4: Removed an old unused file

	Changes made while working on HR-64
	I made some minor changes to the BES while trcking down HR-64.
	The actual fix was in ncml_module, but these cahnges fixed
	formatting and BESDEBUG output.

	Fixed a glitch in volatile container store
	When a real name is passed in and does not contain a leading
	slash (/), don't add it. This change may not matter much in the
	grand scheme of things, but it fixes a failed unit test (pvolT).

	Merge pull request #9 from OPENDAP/bind_using_ip
	Bind using IP

2015-10-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	New feature: Use BES.ServerIP to specify an IP on which to listen
	This was requested by mmceniry@itsc.uah.edu (see https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HR-47).
	If not given, the server reverts to its old behavior of listening
	on the default address. Some of the files' edits are simply reformatting.
	In those cases where most of the file was reformatted and I also
	made a functional change, I put my initials and the date in a comment.

	I removed the calls to the SSL checks; the code does not use SSL

	I moved the unused SSL files in bes/ppt to nes/ppt/old
	I spent an hour modifying these only to realize they are never used!

2015-10-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	This patch moves the static method BESFileLockingCache::assemblePath() to BESUtil::assemblePath(). This was done to make better use of this code, for the rest of the patch, a modification to BESContainerStorageVolatile::add_container() to ensure the real name of the resource was a proper path with no double '/' slash characters.

2015-10-07  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Patched bug in new caching code.

2015-10-06  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Merged cache_control_patch_02 to master branch

	Spun off the timing directory into it's own project @ https://github.com/opendap/bes_timing

	Dropped un-needed include from BESUncompressCache.cc

	Small updates to cache_control_patch_02 prior to issuing pull request

	Small updates to cache_control_patch_02 prior to issuing pull request

	Patched BESFileLockingCache::get_cache_file_name() to reject file names longer than 254 characters. Temporary patch for a lorger issue

2015-10-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Small changes - hunting function test issues.

	Small chnages for clarity

	Adding dispatch/BESUncompressCache class to replace BESCache3

	Updated use of BESFileLockingCache in numerous places to conform correctly to use pattern. Dropped BESCache3 from production and replaced it with BESUncompressCache and GatewayCache as appropriate.

2015-10-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes
	Conflicts: xmlcommand/BESXMLInterface.cc

2015-10-01  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache configuration collisions with various handlers that also were utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir, BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from the other caches.

2015-09-30  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Initial cache control patch (version 2), in which we use the cache_prefix value to form the name of the cache control file.

2015-09-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed old code; still not sure why xmlCleanupParser makes the daemon command processor fail. Removed it; left a comment.

	Calling xmlCleanupParser() in DaemonCommadnHandler is an error
	It results in a double free.

	Added calls to xmlCleanupParser()
	To xmlcommand/BESXMLInterface.cc when an exception is thrown and
	server/DaemonCommandHandler.cc in both the normal and expectional
	cases.

	Fix for the obscure 'XML element order dependen on BESDEBUG'
	The problem was a missing call to xmlCleanupParser in
	BESXMLInterface::build_data_request_plan().

	XML element order dependent on BESDEBUG use.
	The culprit was a missing call to xmlCleanupParser() in
	BESXMLInterface::build_data_request_plan.

	Added 'virutal' to BESStopWatch dtor

2015-09-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed version_update_modules.sh so that it does not mangle Makefile.am
	Before it was incorrectly substituting the verion number.

	Added *.Po to gitignore

	Eliminate linking with .so modules
	Some of the unit tests were linking with the .so modules, which is
	not portable. This might be causing errors in the unit tests. At the
	very least it was sloppy. Also modified the Makefiles so that bes.conf
	files are removed by the clean target.

	Merge pull request #6 from OPENDAP/sigpipe_fix

	Added/fixed message when the child listener catches sigpipe and exits.

	A candidate fix for the runaway beslistener issue.
	My fix is to catch sigpipe and exit if in a child listener.

	quick fix for version_update_modules.sh

2015-09-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	moved version_update_modules.sh to the modules dir

	Added a script to help speed future releases of the BES
	The script version_update_modules.sh will update modules'
	version numbers. It is useful when the modules have changed,
	but not in a way that's hugely important.

	Added exception catches in daemon.cc

	Reduced the scope of the dapreader TypeMatch so that DAS and general XML files are not gnerally identified as daprreader data.

2015-09-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix configure_modules.ac for CentOS6
	The .ac file used 'if test "$libgf_ok"="no" but that
	doesn't work. there must be spaces between the '=' and
	its arguments. Also, the double quotes are not needed.
	Lastly, the AX_COMAPRE_VERSION macro can be replaced
	by AS_COMPARE_VERSION, but the conf/ax_compare_version.m4
	file must remain, maybe because it's needed by other AX
	macros...

	Force a rebuild of the cached libdap 3.15
	This should fix a bug in the FreeForm handler - the new libdap on both
	master and parallel_io has the fix.

2015-09-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Test Travis builds pulling hyrax-deps from Travis' cache.

	Silence the non-error messages from the hyrax-deps build for travis

	More work on the Travis build

	another fix - prefix should not end in 'deps' for hyrax-dependencies

	Another fix/workaround for install_bes-deps...

	Error in install_bes_dep...

	Must force a rebuild of the deps...

	Travis now used hyrax-dependencies
	...instead of a one-off process. No guarantee this will work

	 new scrpit for processing massif output

2015-08-31  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.tw.rpi.edu>

	Compile, test and deploy BES using standard configuration
	Attempting to build a standard configuration of the BES using just the
	modules that I need and without all of the dependencies that I don't
	need. So using the configure_standard.ac configuration file.

	The besd.in file which builds the besd initialization script that goes
	into /etc/init.d was not setting up the prefix variables correctly so
	the bes was not launching using that script.

	configure_standard.ac seemed to have not been updated with the other
	configuration file as it appears to be working.

	dapreader Makefile.am was missing the inclusion of the dap server libs
	to resolve the Ancillary methods used, specificall reading a das
	ancillary file.

2015-08-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a missing double quote in install_bes_source_deps.sh

	Added 'make check' to travis
	... and spiffed up the bes source deps script

	Fixed the install_bes_source_deps.sh script
	...so that it will build libdap 3.15

	The aggregation_improvements branch.
	Requires the parallel_io branch version of libdap and uses the
	pipelining branch version of ncml_module. This version also will
	rebuild the bes deps built using the install_bes_source_deps
	script.

	Removed some very old code that was not used

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:opendap/bes

	Make heap_profiler's output more legible
	Drop the 'depth' down to 1; some other changes.

	Removed the 'xml' string from the dapreader typematch string.

2015-08-19  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added new global timing variables so that we can see how long it takes before we begin the first data read and how long it takes before we begin the first data transmission.

2015-08-11  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added bes commands to illuminate the costs adding additional (time) hyperslabs to a request.

	Added new bes commands to illuminate the memory usage for NcML aggregations and HDF4 files on a per variable basis.

	Will have to debug on an ubuntu machine...

	tests in dapreader fail
	Add -k to make check to see all the tests that fail and if the missing
	gdal library is a problem with the check target.

2015-08-08  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	test if make check -j7 work with travis
	Removing libgdal fixed the issue with uuid/uuid.h - apparently one
	failed apt-get lib caused the other to not load as well. Will make check
	work without libgdal?

	removed libgdal from packages loaded by travis.yml
	This may fix the build, or at least address the uuid/uuid.h not
	found problem (uuid/uuid.h) is found by libdap when building on travis.

2015-08-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes
	Conflicts:
		modules/ncml_module

	tweaked heap_profiler and addedsome info about the AIRX aggregation

	Two new aggregations for use with the heap_profiler script
	These use much smaller variables and smaller data sets, so the
	affect is less pronounced, but it's easy to see how much memory
	was allocated for the actual data returned.

	Added a second 'small aggregation'
	This also uses AIRX and builds a much larger response using a larger
	number of variables. It's about four times the memory footprint of
	the first 'small' aggregation.

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:opendap/bes
	Conflicts:
		timing/mkAggTests

	Added options to mkAggTests
	...to switch between verbose and not and AIRX and not.

	Added a heap_profiler
	Based on code Nathan wrote

2015-08-07  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	tuning test scripts

2015-08-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	timeTest now just runing the timing debug key by default.

	Clean up the ResponseBuilderTest
	The SetUp() method was passing the address to two local objects into
	dynamically allocated objects that have/had a lifetime that exceeded
	their scope. Oops. This does not fix the broken test, but it's a problem
	all the same.

2015-08-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	changes in the modules to make 'check' build the package.m4 files.

2015-08-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Updated mac_profiler script so that it runs valgrind in memcheck and massif mode in addtion to running iprofile if the OS is dected as OS-X (Darwin). Probably need to change the name of the script now that it is getting platform independence.

2015-08-03  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	spellcheck

	Additional instrumentation in BES request food chain

	New timing tests, aggregations, and profiling

2015-07-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for 'make install' since the docker container doesn't allow sudo.
	The fix is to use --prefix with configure.

	Fixing how bes uses autotest
	Also removed make check from travis until the container system is
	working correctly.

2015-07-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Reorder the libraries in dap/unit-tests
	...to fix the travis build

	travis syntax error

	Changed the ax_lib_gdal.m4 macro.
	Now not finding a copy of gdal-config that will run is not an
	error, just a warning.

	Set PATH before the source deps build script

	mis-named the source deps script

	travis fix for container build

	install_bes_source_deps.sh fix

	.travis indentation fix

	Travis now uses docker containers.
	Added install_bes_source_deps.sh script as part of this change

2015-07-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	updated gdal_handler

	updated modules

2015-07-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2015-07-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for distcheck - it's still not working
	..but it gets further along.

2015-07-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2015-07-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Timing run on 7/7/2015

2015-07-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added calls to xmlCleanupParser() and fixed a catch() block in XMLInterface.
	I added calls to xmlCleanupParser() in the terminate() methods
	of ServerApp and StandAloneApp - this elimiates some reported
	leaks from valgrind although they are likely once-per-process
	leaks. Also changed a catch() block in XMLInterface so that
	all excpetions are caught (it is logged and re-thrown); before
	only BESError was caught.

2015-06-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added compile guards for stdlib.h and atexit

	Resource leak in BESCache3 fixed
	This is a minor issue, but the storage for the singleton was being
	leaked and showes upin valgrind leak reports. This fix was to add a
	void () function that deletes the global pointer and is called using
	atexit().

2015-06-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Travis build; hdf5 fix
	Changed the HDF5 library configure so that the HDF5 library is installed
	in /usr/local.

	Fixed timeTest so that it will work for DDX responses.

	*.log --> *.txt: Easier to import to a spreadsheet.

	Reran the AIRX timing tests
	I think the timing was stoped while it ran the first time,
	leading to values that were way too high (by a factor of two).
	[ci skip]

2015-06-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	another hack to the travis.yml file.
	Also a minor edit to the configure.ac file.

	The log is just too big - redirect stdout from the three source builds to /dev/null

	Baselines for the four sample aggregations.

	Removed the hdf5-serial-dev package in favor of a source tar ball.
	This addresses an issue where the debian package using an older
	API than our code. The newer ubuntu dists have packages that
	don't look like they have this problem, but we're stuck at ubuntu 12
	with Travis.

	Added the ncml used to build the aggregations
	... and made minor edits to the README

	Added the 6.19.15 baselines
	These files contain performance data from an early run of these
	tests. There were a number of problems with the handlers/datasets
	that had to be sorted out, but I thought it was important to save
	this data. The raw logs are huge (many files > 500M) so I'll not
	put those in github now (but they are backed up using an AMI
	snapshot).

	Removed the Grid_lat and Grid_lon variables from the GPM aggregations.
	With the changes made by THG, these variables no longer appear
	in the DDS.

2015-06-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved the rest of the DMR commadn files to 'DMR_command' dirs

	Moved the DMR bescmd in TRMM_3B42 to DMR_commands
	...because the dmr response does not work yet.

	Moved the TRM_3A11 dmr tests to DMR_commands
	...so they will not be run. The NcML handler does not build valid
	DMR responses. These are not properly constrained.

2015-06-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	Added 'ddx' to the set of extensions recognized.
	...but we don't actually run ddx tests

	bes cmd files changed
	I found that the 'granule' files were actually accessing all of the
	granules in the aggregation. I edited them so that only one granule
	is accessed.

	Merge branch 'timing_jhrg' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into timing_jhrg
	Fixed conflicts with timeTest.

2015-06-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed tests and install from travis.yml
	...just get the build working for now

	travis.yml: break the build apart to find if make works but the tests fail.

	travis.yml: The libdap dep seems set now... turn on the handlers

	travis.yml: libdap-3.14.0 needs bison
	Actually, configure requires it, but the new tar.gz is built with the
	generated sources, so it's not really needed.

	New approach to the libdap dependency - build it from a tar.gz

2015-06-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into timing_jhrg

	Added -d and -D options to timeTest

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:opendap/bes

	Changed reps and the order of debug options
	Changed debug options from cerr,timing,ncml to cerr,ncml,timing

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes.git into timing_jhrg

	Reorganization of the bescmd files and minor changes to the bash scripts
	...with an eye toward being able to run these independently and making
	the result(s) a little easier to understand.

2015-06-19  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	simple timing tests

2015-06-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hack travis.yml: run configure using --without-dap-modules

	Reformat and cleanup the timing/README
	[ci skip]

	Modify the travis bes build to use make -k -j7
	I need to see all the places the build will fail...

2015-06-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the libcurl4 package to libcurl4-gnutls-dev
	...since that's what seems to be loaded. I also changed the dep in the
	libdap.deb to that as well.

	debugging the travis.yml
	...there's some issue with libcurl4 and libdap.deb

	More travis/libdap.deb work...

	travis hack Re: libdap deb (--force-overwrite)

	Fixed broken hdf5 dev packge in travis.yml

	Updates to travis.yml
	Now attempts to use apt-get for all the dependencies. Uses a .deb
	package for libdap to avoid building it, as well.

2015-06-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	Added travis.yml
	This (initial) version of travis.yml builds the hyrax-dependencies and
	libdap4 projects too. There might be a better way, to do this, however.

2015-06-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Dropped h4 and h5 debug switches from basic timing

	Adjusted constraint ecpressions in  agg performance test commands to avoid invoking the subset of aggregation var bug

2015-06-10  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Updated READEME

	Added top level timing test driver script

	Added README and organized timing directory

2015-06-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Rmoved aggregation variable 'time'from constraint expression used in grnule file.

2015-06-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	 Tuning timing tests and commands

2015-06-03  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Adding timing tests (bes command files)

	Changes from github

	Small updates to StopWatch implementation.

	Adding timing tests to BES.

2015-06-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESStopWatch changes
	I added to the previous fixes: Fixed up the ctor parameters so
	they used the initialization list, reordered them to match the
	declaration order, removed the static string object, and moved
	the cotrs to the header (still they only contain inits).

2015-06-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'make-mask-alternative'

2015-05-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for 'configure can't find gdal' bug

2015-05-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed unused includes; fixed a comment

	Added back second test; removed some dead code

	Reformatted BESDapResponseCache.cc
	It has a bug, but this just fixes teh formatting and not the bug

	Modified make_mask()
	This version of make_mask() no longer takes a Grid size as its first
	two arguments; now it takes a 'shape string' that provides the number
	and size of each dimension of the resulting mask. However, I realized
	that was probably not needed since that same info can come from the
	dimensions that are passed in. I'm commiting this version, all the
	same.

2015-05-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the name of dilate_array to dilate_mask
	But left the C++ files DilateArrayFunction.cc/h since changing those
	takes more effort.

	Copyright date correction

	Added the dilate_array() function to the handler and added reg. tests

	Fixed some minor compilation issues in DilateArrayFunction

2015-05-26  dh-opendap  <d.holloway@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'uri-mask' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into uri-mask

	Updated functionsTest.at

2015-05-26  Dan Holloway  <dan@Dans-MBP.home>

	Added DilateArrayFunction

2015-05-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hacked version of make_mase()
	For this version, floating point values only have to be <= 0.1 different
	to match. This is a hack, but we can revisit it later. It's in Jira.

	Fixed/Added tests for make_mask()
	I moved and renamed the initial test bescmd file from tests/functions
	to tests/bescmd/make_mask_coads_{1,2}.bescmd and changed the data set
	the the coads.dods file in tests/data (that is read using dapreader).
	Both tests pass and it seems like the values are correct.

	Added 'optimization' for Odometer::set_indices()
	Removed multiply by one.

	Added 3D test for make_mask
	also reformatted Odometer.h

	Removed DODS_DEBUG; added 2D unit test for make_mask_helper

	Initial unit test - a one-dimensional case

	Merge branch 'uri-mask' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into uri-mask

	Added extract_uint_value() to functions_util.h
	..,just needed a declaration. Also added some documentation to the make
	mask helper.

2015-05-25  Dan Holloway  <dan@Dans-MBP.home>

	Added mask_coads test files.

	Added extract_uint_value(), and returned DAP Array from MakeMaskFunction.

2015-05-24  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added BES command to timing log

2015-05-22  Dan Holloway  <dan@Dans-MBP.fios-router.home>

2015-05-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added set_indices() to Odometer.
	...and tests

	Added all_indices_valid() function
	Also added a test, just to be complete...

	Minor compiler error in MakeMaskFunction.cc fixed

2015-05-22  Dan Holloway  <dan@Dans-MBP.home>

	Including odometer construction.

	Updated, removing #if0, and converted to mask to vector<byte>

2015-05-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modifications to MakeMaskFunction
	The code compiles. To get that I used #if 0 ... endif to remove some of
	the code (because it called functions that haven't been written). I
	added two new functions that I hope will make it easier to build up
	information needed to set pixels in the mask. I added unit tests for
	those new functions.

	Added unit test for find_value_indices()

	Added a unit test for find_value_index().

	Added a proto-unit-test for Make Mask

	Module update (commit and push)

	modules sync

	Formatting

	Now functions/swath2grid builds correctly; it is not included, however.
	Repaired the configure search for gdal. Also fixed an
	error in the software. This code is not, however, included
	in the build by default. It's just not quite ready. Modify
	functions/Makefile.am to build/use it.

	Call setgroups() before relinquishing root.

2015-05-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Making it easier to build dapreader-uasable data for tests
	...but it's still not 100% there. DAP2 Grids fail.

	Removed old cruft about functions module from dapreader/tests/bes.conf.in

	Fixed an issue with --without-dap-modules

	Fixed getopt() use. Patch from O. Poplawski.

2015-05-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Formatting; BESKeys default ctor lacked field inializers.

2015-05-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	All-static module build now works.

2015-05-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Simple formatting fixes for code in 'functions'

	Fixed problems in besd and bescmdln
	The besd script failed with installed from the rpm because the
	bes prefix was set to /usr and then passed to besctl, which broke
	all kinds of things. I removed that and the unused exec_prefix
	and 'source functions' lines. Also, bescmdln logic made it so
	that the value given with -p was ignored.

2015-05-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added #include <iterator> to MaskArrayFunctionTest.cc
	...for CentOS 6

2015-05-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed DAP4 function evaluation
	There was a bug where the result of the function was followed
	by a dump of the entire DMR.

	Reformatted files

	Fixed an integration test for mask_array()
	The test used the wrong variable. I also found that some of the
	data files used by the integration tests were not in git.

	Added (more) test baselines for mask_array()

2015-04-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the mask_array() function to the functions module
	... and added regression tests for mask_array(). DAP4 function working
	although there's a bug with the libdap evaluator code.

	mask_array() unit tests include a test for the DAP4 version.

	mask_array() now has complete QC and more tests

2015-04-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Proto version of mask_array()
	Helper function working and unit tests written

2015-04-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	checkpoint: Adding mask_array() server function

	Formatting edits to MakeArrayFunction.cc/h

2015-04-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed typo in configure_modules.ac
	GRIDFIELDS was spelled incorrectly.

2015-04-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Gridfields fix
	configure was not finding libgridfields - or rather - when it
	did find it in the supplied dependencies, the library was not
	used.

	doxygen fixes
	doxy.conf is now a generated file.

2015-04-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	submodule commits

	Added #include of <cstdlib> for OdometerTest
	C++ failed to sort out the abs() overload without <cstdlib>. ...but
	not on OSX.

2015-04-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	distcheck now works with configure_modules.ac

	ChangeLog, NEWS, READ and INSTALL updates for 3.14
	This includes updates to the ChangeLog and version information
	for all of the submodule handlers.

2015-04-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Version number in NEWS to 3.14.0

	Bumped up the versions in the spec files for libdap
	...now libdap/-devel 3.14.0 is required.

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes
	Conflicts:
		modules/csv_handler

	Updated relese version numbers in configure.ac and the spec files.

	Added to teh fortify target for the bes.

2015-04-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Makefile.am now supports a new 'all-static' rpm.
	This target (all-static-rpm) expects to find the dependencies for
	all of the handlers either on a plain RHEL6 machine or in the special
	static dependencies installed in $prefix/deps where $prefix is set
	in the shell and used as the value of --prefix to the hyrax-dependencies
	project. This requires that the hyrax-dependencies be built with this
	static linking in mind.

2015-04-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the besd script.
	Now it installs in /etc/rc.d/init.d like a good system V daemon
	init script and has the run levels set properly. This requires
	RHEL 6.

2015-04-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Pushed the NSIDC changes to fileout_netcdf; updating submodule

2015-03-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	New commits in the submodules
	Mostly ignored generated conf files but there are
	some build fixes too (for 'make check' when CppUnit
	is not present).

	Fixed an issue with gridfileds tests
	There was a syntax error plus a botched test.

2015-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	dap-server update

2015-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed rpm name
	RPM has odd rules about what chars can appear where

	Added NASA-specific RPM spec file
	see bes.spec.nasa

2015-03-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	Accomodate autoconf 2.63
	Modifications to the submodules

	Change configure_modules.ac: autoconf version changed (back) to 2.63.
	Also changed calls to AT_ARG_OPTION_ARG so that the multi-word options
	use underscores and not dashes (needed for 2.63 but not later versions).

	Modifications to make a 'NASA' rpm
	This will include hdfeos2 and hdf4 statically linked to the
	hdf4_handler because that's what has to be. I have added a new
	target in the Makefile (nasarpm) that will do this and made
	changes to configure so that a partial build of the dependencies
	will provide the stuff needed.

	Note that the hdf4 library is still not linking statically! Return
	to this ASAP.

2015-03-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the RPM targets

2015-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	RPM now builds correctly from teh command line...
	...the Makefile target needs some work though, because rpmbuild
	is confused by the multiple spec files in the tar.gz. Either remove
	them or run rpmbuild -ba or -bb and pass in the spec file on that
	command line. Could make the dist, but will need to copy it to
	the rpmbuild topdir/SOURCES.

	CentOS distcheck now works!

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	Updated all the submodules for the distcheck changes.

	Merged from stash after switching back to master.

	Various changes for distcheck.

2015-03-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'jg_distcheck' of https://github.com/opendap/bes into jg_distcheck
	Conflicts:
		configure_modules.ac

	minor edit to configure_modules.ac

	Modified configure.ac
	Now 'pax' tar is used to build the dist so the long filenames
	in the hdf4 and 5 handlers don't force a build fail. I also
	cleaned up the functions and functions/swath2grid Makefile.am
	files.

	Fixes for distcheck
	For the bes.conf files, use the test's Makefile.am to build the
	conf file so that we can strip the ../ from @abs_top_srcdir@. I also
	fixed some botched include directives where files were included
	using 'dispatch/BESDebug.h', etc., which will clearly break using
	distcheck.

	Removed dap/tests from the build
	The tests in this code depend on dapreader, but that dir is not built
	until this one has finished!

	Change pushed for fo json

	New module commits

	Modules update

	Updated baselines in functions/tests
	dapreader uses series values from the Test* classes and I moved the
	tests here from dapreader (since this is where the functions are defined
	and this code is built after the dapreader code - so the tests were
	not being run back in the dapreader dir).

	Cleaned up the ResponseBuilder & ResponseCache tests.
	They used system("rm ...") and I added "2>/dev/null" to cut down on the
	extra error messages.

2015-03-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Ignore the messy merge from an old stash until I have time to look it over carefully.

	...working on distcheck
	This is a checkpoint on my branch.

	Moved tests for DAP4 functions here from dapreader.

	I moved the function tests to 'functions'.
	In the main Makefile.am, 'functions' is built after this directory.
	Thus, the function module is not normally available when dapreader is
	first built.

	I removed the AggregationServer class for Sequence.
	The code is still in git, but not part of the build or the tests.

2015-03-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a duplicate delete bug; added tests.
	Found and fixed an issue in tabular when building tables of arrays of
	differing sizes. In that case, BaseType* were being copied, not
	duplicated. Later the Sequence dtor deleted all the pointers, causing
	a duplicate delete operation. Bummer. Lots of pointer dups now...

	Removed roi() function tests and added modified submodules

	In BESCatalog.h: shortened the private ctor to a declaration
	...because that's all you need and you don't get warnings about
	missing initializations.

	Additions to tabular() - more sanity checking
	...but no more tests. One issue found with integration testing when
	asking for tables from arrays where the independent variables have rank
	N and the dependent have rank N+1 and one or more granule has no data
	that match the selection criteria.

2015-03-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for different dimensions to tabular()
	The first version of tabular() required all arrays to be the same size.
	The new version supports the case where one or more array is one
	dimension larger than the rest of the arrays. The tests pass, but there
	is still considerable work to do for the code to be ready for use.

	Fixed the roi() baselines so they pass.
	A better fix would be to subclass the types (Byte, ...) in dapreader
	so that it is not using the Test* types. See Trac...

2015-03-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated fo json

2015-03-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'agg_server'

	Updated hashes for the agg_server branch

	Updated the modules hashes

	Added integration tests for tabular()

	Addition to TabularSequence so that selection expressions work
	I modified TabularSequence so that selection expressions work for both
	binary (aka dods) and ASCII responses. I also modified the tests so
	there are fewer warnings about mismatched sizes and added some comments
	to TabularFunction

	Minor refactor in BESDapResponseBuilder
	I changed some logic that was especially hard to follow and looked at
	making the send_dap2_data() method easier to use in other code, esp.
	in the asciival handler.

2015-03-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2015-03-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge after stash pop

	Merged after a pull of agg_server
	I needed to build the agg_server branch on the
	AWS test-mule running CentOS 6 and in the process
	fixed a number of issues - it might have been
	more savvy to have built/fixed the master and then
	merged down to agg_server, but ...

2015-03-04  opendap  <support@opendap.org>

	Fixes for building on CentOS 6
	Most of the build issues cover #include filenames where
	OSX is not case sensitive but linux is. Some other issues
	are somewhat perplexing (a missing call to generate package.m4).
	Also, the tests for the dap module contain some baselines
	that use hash values that are machine/os specific and I've
	removed those for now.

2015-03-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed distclean in standalone

	Fixed distclean in cmdln

	BBoxFunction supports N-dim boxes
	Based on the 'Odometer' class; includes tests. I verified
	that the 1-d and 2-d tests pass when using the
	general algorithm but did not add any 3-d tests.

	Copied the roi() tests to standalone (from cmdln)
	I'm starting to think that we should have a special dir for
	end-to-end tests where the whole server is used but still does
	not have to be installed. By making the dir separate from the
	code, we can make sure it is listed last and/or not listed
	if the modules are not built as part of the bes build.

	Added one more test file for the roi() code

	Added Odometer class; modified tests.
	Odometer will be used to make a general bbox() function - one that works
	for arrays with any number of dimensions and ne that can be used to
	make minimal boxes that are the unions of regions, not other boxes.
	I also tweaked the test code and marked most of the regression tests
	as xfail since they will until we fix dapreader (Trac #2286). Lastly,
	I added a subset version of the Modis 04 file that's easier to use
	for tests since it's possible to figure out if the bbox/roi code is
	working.

2015-03-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added more tests for the BBoxUnionFunction class.

2015-02-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	One new baseline...

	Partial code review
	Added comments; removed an unused function; and modified one
	to be a bit more useful when errors are found.

	Added a 2d bbox unit test.

	Fixed BBoxUnion so it handles 'intersection'
	Added tests, but only for 1d bboxes; need to add tests for two
	dimensions.

2015-02-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added unit-tests for BBoxUnion.
	I know there are problems with "intersection"; "union" looks
	OK, but the test needs to be completed.

	Added to gitignore

	Added tests for roi(); interection mode for bbox_union
	These seem to round out the roi(), bbox() and bbox_union()
	functions. I'm going to work more on better end-to-end testing
	that does not use the cmdln tool (which means that the server
	much be installed and running).

	Added baseline for bbox_union test

	Added working code to BBoxUnionFunction
	...and one test. Now we need a real bounding box function!

2015-02-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added nascent version of BBoxUnion.
	Not done, but compiles.

	Refactor RoiFunction
	Moved the bbox utils to their own file so I can use them with the
	bbox_union() function.

	Comments added/fixed
	I poked around in the BES code with Patrick on the
	phone and added some notes, TODOs, etc. Mostly these
	came about while we were talking about aggregation
	and the multiple container code in the BES.

	I fixed debug builds
	Now debug (./configure --enable-developer) builds of
	the BES copile the sources using -O0 and -g3.

	Simple tests of roi() using installed handlers.
	This is the first of the end-to-end tests for the server
	function. These test if the function runs using the
	dap module evaluator (different than using besstandalone
	or a unit-test!) and if the output can be chained
	to other transmitters like fileout_netcdf (it can).
	The tests work, but I have not 'made them automatic'
	yet because I'm not sure what that would mean for
	typical builds (i.e., I think the the BES has to be
	installed for these to work).

	More testing for the roi() and bbox() functions.
	Added unit and regression tests, fixed a few bugs
	and started on end-to-end testing.

	Initial stab at regression tests for roi() and bbox()
	The bbox() function is still dumb; it always returns a 10x10
	box. However, these tests show that roi() wrks with hdf4 data
	and inout from bbox().

	Added a two-array test for the roi() function.

2015-02-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added gitignore and some ignores to functions/unit-tests

	More roi() tests
	Test with a 2d array pass and with 2 1d arrays look good but need
	more work.

	Initial version of roi()
	This version of roi() subsets (slices) N arrays using a 'slice'
	array like that produced by the bbox() function also recently added.
	Tested for one 1-d array only so far

	Initial version of bbox(). Placeholder.
	The function is fully formed _except_ that it lacks a way to
	actually determine the bounding box. That will come later once
	I have the other functions coded and tested. The commit includes
	two unit tests. DAP2 only.

2015-02-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added bescmd for tabular() with multiple containers.
	However, in the BES's current configuration, this doesn't make much
	sense, so this is mostly checked in as a place holder to keep the idea
	alive and not something that should actually work.

	Added example aggregation BES commands.
	These don't all work, but they are useful examples, all the same.

	Reverted to teh old dataset name behavior in dapreader.
	Dataset names from .dods and .data files use the name
	in the Dataset {} <name>; syntax element and not the
	filename. I also checked in some changes in dap-server,
	fo json (from a merge) and ncml_module.

2015-02-19  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added w10n_handler submodule to bes preoject.

2015-02-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added to gitignore

	SequenceAggregationServer ready for more testing
	Added regression tests for the Sequence AS and they pass. However,
	testing using the libdap TestSequence class is of limited used because
	it does not know about stored values. I'm commiting this and will
	test against the TabularSequence type returned by the tabular()
	function in the functins module.

	Added regression tests for the Sequence Aggregation Server
	...but not baselines for some because they fail.

	Sequence Aggregation Server check point
	The Sequence Aggregation Server will process a DDS response correctly,
	returning the DDS for the aggregated result. The DataDDS response is
	still a work in progress...

	Unit tests for the new Sequence Aggregation Server

2015-02-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed dapreader so that it supports multiple containers.
	When reading from a dap2 or dap4 data response, the code in
	Connect is not 'container safe' so this handler reads into a
	temporary DDS and then transfers the resulting variables. At
	this point, processing global attributes is not handled for
	a multi-container response (but it's hard to know how that
	should be handled by this code).

2015-02-11  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Replaced use of unique_ptr with auto_ptr for compiler luddites like myself.

2015-02-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed from unique_ptr to auto_ptr
	gcc 4.2 on OS/X 10.7 does not support unique_ptr yet.

	Updated the gitignore files in dap-server and fo json.

2015-02-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The dapreader 'error' tests use a pattern rule now.
	A persistent problem with the tests here that check the parser's
	detection of errors was that the baselines were compared to
	the output using a litteral match. When the source line numbers
	changed, the tests failed (i.e., every time the code was
	edited). I switched to an AT_...PATTERN... test driver, modified
	the baselines to contain just the txt of the error message,and
	the problem went away.

	Minor tweak to GridGeoConstraint test
	I added some initializer code to quite a warning.

	Reactivated the regression tests in dap
	Modified configure_modules.ac, the tests, etc. However,
	at this point the tests actually do nothing - these were
	completely broken. I will start out adding some tests for
	the new AggregationServer handler added to this dir.

2015-02-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added Sequence AggregationServer, 0.1

	Merge branch 'master' into agg_server

	Added some generated scripts to gitignore

	Fixed the indentation of BESDapResponseBuilder.cc
	No functional change

	Merge branch 'tabular'
	This adds the tabular() function. The tabular function
	takes one or more arrays that meet certain criteria and
	builds a table from their values. Each array is one
	columnn in the table (sequence). A subclass of libdap::Sequence
	is defined to make serialization and ce evaluation work
	correctly. Includes tests.

	TabularSequence now supports selection.
	I modified the serialize() method of TabukarSequence so
	that it supports selection expressions. It's not the best
	in terms of performance (I suspect; no actuall performance
	measurement yet). Also, configure_modules.ac supports the
	new regression tests.

2015-02-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added unit tests for the D4 version of tabular()

	Added a test baseline for tabular

	Initial regression tests for tabular - working
	I subclassed Sequence to get the DAP2 version of tabular to
	work. The issue was that Sequence::serialize is broken WRT
	a sequence that is already loaded with data values.

	Added tests for tabular

	Added to functions/tests/data so the data work with dapreader
	I added a bes conf file (build_responses.conf) that will work
	to build .dods, ..., files from netcdf data files so that we
	can test using real data without having to first build specific
	format handlers.

2015-02-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added two gitignore files

	New an improved version of tabular()
	The function now works correctly with N arrays and tests their
	shape for correctness (all arrays must match in shape for this
	version of the function). Also included are unit tests.

2015-02-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	New changes in the modules.

	The new AggregationServer.

	Added initial version of tabular().
	This version of tabular() works witj a single one dimension
	array and may work with others, but is untested for those cases.
	Has a unit test file.

	The agg_server branch
	Partial progress on an AggregationServer. This code is a
	'null aggregation server' that prints out information about
	the DHI it gets passed. Maybe useful later on...

	Repaired fragile tests
	These tests failed because the line number of the code
	that throws an exception changed. We need to change how
	tests like this compare against their baseline - use a
	regex or just test for an error return?

	Added info about DAP2 vs DAP4 to README and INSTALL

2015-02-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

2015-02-02  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/bes

	Simplifed the check_path() function by using a function pointer to eliminate two identical logic paths that utilized two different version of the stat function depending on the value of a passed paramter. The new verion assigns a function pointer based on the value of the parameter and then only one block of logic follows. This simplifies maintenence and readability. Additionally added from debugging instrumentation.

2015-01-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added some new test code to dapreader
	The new tests are for Sequences and multi-container requests
	where each containers is a sequence. This was added as part of the
	NASA work on Swath aggregation.

	Fixed an issue with multiple containers and dapreader
	The dapreader handler failed when containers were used and the DAS
	was empty because a test in DDS::transfer_attr() that checked for a
	matching hierarchy between the two objects (DAS and DDS) would fail.
	I patched this by no calling transfer_attr() when the DAS is empty.

2015-01-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed an error in configure_modules.ac
	The header 'strings.h' was misspelled 'trings.h'.

2015-01-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed dist-hook which as a hack for SVN.
	I updated the modules as well, commiting them too.
	Also, I added LT_INIT in the bes configure_modules.ac.

2015-01-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed my too-hastily applied patch to BindName.
	I modified the D4 function parser in libdap so that string constants
	do not include the double quotes that delimit their values. The call
	to remove_quotes() here was then redundant.

2015-01-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed test issues in dapreader
	These issues were actually due to a subtle change in the DAP4 function
	parser. Sting constants are now returned with their double quotes.
	This is so that variable names can be passed into functions even when
	those names are quoted (because they contain spaces or meta
	characters). The tests assumed unquoted names. I wonder about this,
	but I'm checking in the fix and adding a note to jira/trac.

	Added empty cache dirs
	We need four cache dirs to make the tests in dap/unit-tests
	work correctly. I added these 'empty' dirs by putting a crafty
	gitignore file in them and adding it to the index.

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/dap4'
	Conflicts:
		dap/unit-tests/ResponseCacheTest.cc
		dapreader/Makefile.am

2014-12-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated INSTALL and README
	They now contain text describing git and the two ways the
	code can be built.

2014-12-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed configre_modules.ac - stuff got lost in the merge

	Moved configure.ac to configure_standard.ac
	The 'mosules' build uses a new configure.ac and several
	AM_CONDITIONAL variables; the standard build configure.ac
	does not and there's no way to make automake be 'conditional'
	itself. So... There are two configure.ac files, one named
	..._modules and the other named ..._standard. Thre's no
	file named 'configure.ac' in git so that builders don't forget
	to switch.

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/modules'
	Conflicts:
		configure.ac

	Last set of changes made on the modules branch regarding the
	dist target and building from the tarball.

	Changes so that make dist and a build of the tarball work.

	Restored the 'standard' build configure.ac
	This code will now support both the standard build where
	the bes alone builds - autoreconf -fiv followed by the
	usual suspects will build and install the bes framework.
	Copying the configure_modules.ac to configure.ac and running
	those commands after using git's submodule commands to clone
	the Hyrax module set will build the bes and all of the modules.
	See INSTALL for more information.

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/modules'
	Conflicts:
		dap/unit-tests/response_cache/.gitignore

2014-12-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Module updates - specifically to factor setting the module name and version information out of the configure script and into the module's Makefile.am

2014-12-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes in csv, dap-server and ncml.

	Removed besregtest from the rpm spec file

	The spec file now requires 3.13.3

	Added directory response_cache.

	Updated the gitmodules file for ugrid and ncml.
	Both of these lacked a 'branch = modules' line, so the submodule
	update command was using the master branch.

2014-12-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the dapreader regression tests.
	These tests were commented out and the dapreader handler/module was
	linked with several of the bes libraries. This meant that other
	tests that used the module were broken.

	Added ugrid_functions to the bes modules build.

2014-12-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for the bes modules build.

	Added hdf5_handler to the bes modules build.
	Also fixed issues in the gateway module test code and pushed
	those to github.

2014-11-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added hdf4_handler to the bes modules build.

	Added the *.conf files to git ignore

	Added gdal_handler to the bes modules build.

2014-11-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the fits_handler to the bes modules build.

2014-11-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed configure.ac when --without-dap-modules is used.

	Fixed configure.ac so that FOUND_OPENJPEG is defiend even if BUILD_GDAL is not.

2014-11-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tweaked the xml handler module given that hdf4/5 are not yet working.

	Added fieout_gdal to the BES modules build

	Modified .gitmodules so that it tracks the modules branch of gateway_module by default.

	Added gateway_module to the BES modules branch/build.

	Added fileout_netcdf to the BES modules build.

	Added netcdf_handler to the bes modules build.

2014-11-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modifications for the modules build.
	Added the Freeform and xml_data handlers. The dist target works, as
	does make install.

2014-11-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the freeform handler to the modules build.

2014-11-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Configured submodules to use the 'modules' branch
	I editied the .gitmodules file so that csv, fileout json and
	dap-server call should use the 'modules' branch by default when
	cloned using the bes 'modules' branch.

	Found and fixed the ResponseCacheTest error.
	The problem with the ResponsecacheTest unit test was that it
	depended on the 'response_cache' directory already existing. But
	git does not (it seems) fetch/update/etc. empty directories. I
	added a .gitignore file in the directory and set it to ignore
	everything except the .gitignore file.

	Added fileout_json to the modules build.

	Changes in the modules dirs for csv and dap-server.

	Added more handlers to the modules branch
	Tweaked the configure.ac file so that dap-server now builds; the
	configure script now has some new makefile variables for handlers
	to use when linking unit-tests. I added the dap-server, fileout_json,
	freeform and xml_data handlers to this branch.

2014-11-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Support for the 'modules' build
	Modified configure.ac so that it will build the Makefiles for all of
	the modules in the new modules subdir. Added 'subdir-objects' to the
	Makefile.am files in the bes build that need it (to suppress the wordy
	warning message). Also added .gitignore.

	Added csv_handler in modules dir

2014-10-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added include of D4Dimensions.h
	M    functions/BindShapeFunction.cc

2014-10-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I re-indented this code because it was too hard to read.

	Added more tests and fixed 2256 where a .dods response, frozen to a file and a .das response were not being merged correctly. The problem was that the bescmd file had to specify that the context 'use_explicit_containers' was set to 'no'. Not setting this caused the handler to fail when trying to read the DAS file.

2014-10-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for ticket 2258 - Modules with names that contained the string 'dap' were loaded before the dap module. Fixed.

	Added fix for bug 2258 where the module fails to load. The problem seems to be in the BES itself and the way that modules are loaded, but a fix is to change the name of the module in the conf file (from 'dapreader' to anything that does not contain the string 'dap').

	Removed cruft

2014-09-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added some tests for the DAP4 functions using the code in the functions module - might move this to the functions module in the near future...

	Added some tests for the DAP4 functions using the code in the functions module - might move this to the functions module in the near future...

	I imposed some sanity on the organization of the test data files.

	Added DAP4 a function eval call to the send dap4 data code. I also cleared out some of the old boolean stuff inherited from DAP2's ce eval code.

	Log message text fix

2014-09-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed comment

2014-09-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed the old OPENDAP_DEBUG_OPTIONS macro from many configure.ac files.

2014-09-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a few files for DAP2 Sequences as part of testing issues with nested sequences in DAP4. ...need to organize the dap2 versus dap4 files here a bit better if/when we start using this for more tests. ...unless the data for those tests are kept in the handlers that uses them.

2014-09-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed an unneeded use of auto_ptr.

2014-09-08  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Spelling

	Another fix for the unit-tests in bes/dap - I think the cache dirs are finally cleaned properly.

	I found that the test for escaped pathnames was failing and the baseline was bogus. I added a ticket, modified the baseline to contain a note about the ticket and made that test 'xfail'.

	Updated README

	Added support for DAP4 responses from DAP2 response files. The code may not work for DAP2 responses that contain Structure or Sequences. For these to work we may need to subclass the TestType implementations for those classes.

	Added support for DAP4 responses from DAP4 data response files. made the DAP2 responses more general (including support for DAP2 dds responses from DAP2 data response files). No support for DAP4 stuff from DAP2 response files yet - not sure if this is needed.

2014-09-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Reading .dap documents now works for both .dmr and .dap requests (although there are some issues like DAP4_Checksum_CRC32 appearing in DMR responses and appearing twice in DAP responses). DAP2 object/response support not added. All tests still pass.

	Modified dapreader so that it will build a DMR from both DMR/XML (text) files and .dap response files. This same basic code can be extended to include building DAP4 responses from DDS and DataDDS 'files'. The intent is that getdap and getdap4 will be used to build the data files and this handler will be able to feed DMR/DDS objects into Transmitter handlers. I also removed the unused SupportDAP4 parameter from the dapreader.conf.in file.

	Added comment about a leak fix.

2014-08-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	svn ignores

	Fixe3d the tests so they run correctly using make check -j9 - they did not work correctly with a parallel build.

2014-08-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the dapreader issues; fixed some issues in the Makefile.am files regarding distcheck.

2014-08-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Spelling in an error message

	fixed the name of the dapreader module in the template bes conf file that's used for the handler install

2014-08-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Now gets the xml:base context and sets the correct part of the DMR object

	Formatting changes as I worked through adding DAP4 support to the CSV handler.

2014-08-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I remove the unlock_and_close(int fd) method of BESFileLockingCache because it did not update the list of open descriptors - the version of this method that takes a filename argument does. Mixing the two methods lead to descriptors being closed twice. The bug did not show up here but it did on the dap4 branch.

	Fixed an error BESFileLockingCache where a cached file could be unlocked using its file descriptor and not its name. Doing so meant that the recorded descriptor was left on a list of descriptors to close and then would be 'closed twice' in some cases. I also fixed an error in the Makefile.am for the unit tests in dap where the installed libraries were used instead of the build libraries (in the source directories). Other changes/fixes are the result of adding support for the DMR response to the CSV handler.

2014-08-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	All the latest changes from the trunk including the 1.9.9 changes - the previous merge likely got the changes up to 1.9.8, not 1.9.9 as the comment says.

	Merged code from the trunk so that the changes there for the last set of Hyrax releases will be available. This includes changes up to version 1.9.9 of Hyrax

2014-05-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Quick fix for bug #2194 - the BES cache opens files twice but closes them only once when working with compressed files. This is a quick fix where both BESCache3 and BESFileLockingCache have been hacked. The tests are sort of hosed because they use the old caching code - which I have removed along with BESDAPCache. The old unused code made this problem take much longer to find. Next I'll try making BESCache3 a child of FileLockingCache.

2014-05-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	the dapreader handler now works as a simple DAP4 test server for DMR requests. I had to change its name from dapreader to reader because it seems 'dapreader' gets loaded before 'dap' and that leads to undefined symbols.

	bes: More instrumentation for PPT_EXIT_NOW handling

2013-10-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added code to log receipt of the EXIT_NOW PPT token. Also, added some more comments about where different parts of the socket I/O code are implemented. I think these changes, combined with others recently made, fix the issues we've seen on Linux where the OLFS encounters I/O failures when it 'uses up' a BES and retires it for a new beslistener child. This should also address the ticket that requests a log entry when the BES 'dies' since the exit code and signal handlers now log information.

	Modified Socket::receive() so that it handles EINTR and EAGAIN correctly on read() calls to the socket.

	The command line client now sends the zero-length chunk that follows the EXIT_NOW extension chunk that indicates to the server that the client has closed the PPT connection.

	Fixed the way the EXIT_NOW state/chunk is handled by the BESServerHandler class (it should be looking for a trailing zero-length chunk following the 'extension' chunk that indicates 'EXIT_NOW').

	fixed the return code info for child processes; bescmdln now has defaults for/of localhost and port 10022

	Commented out the calls to terminate/exit in the sig pipe handler of the beslistener.

	Changed "besdaemon" and "server" to "beslistener" in the BESDEBUG calls in ServerApp.cc

	Added catch of sig pipe and log output for all signal handlers.

	Fixed debugT to account for the change to BESDEBUG

	Updated the FSF address in the copyright headers; added missing copyright information.

2013-09-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This checkin contains a fix for the conflicting definitions of width() in BaseType, Vector and Array, where Array provided a version/definition that clashes with the one in BaseType. BaseType defined width() and Array defined width(bool constrained = true), which shadowed the former. I changed BaseType width so that its signature is width(bool constrained = false) and made that the only version of the method. There are some changes to uses of width() in libdap and the BES, but not in the handlers.

2013-09-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	removed -fno-defer-pop from all copies of Makefile.am since the new OSX compiler prints warnings about it and it seems to not make a difference with newer g++ versions.

2013-07-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Trunk fixes for the functions module in the libdap andbes spec files. Also a repair to XDRStreamMarshaller.cc

2013-07-08  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for the distcheck target. It's not quite right, but only one issue remains.

2013-07-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added tests

	big tests...

	big test...

	Tests for the various #<type>(N:values...) special forms

	Added bind_shape(). Changed the name of make_array()'s anoanymous variables to 'g' from 'anon'.

2013-07-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added functions/tests to configure.ac

2013-06-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed the old dap.conf stuff - it's now in the dap module. Saved in a new directory named 'old'.

	Fixed a problem with the hack that parses out functions - it was garbling nested calls. Also, I switched to the stream versions of the marshaller code - no more FILE*.

	Fixed a glitch in bind_name() where variables already in the DDS could not be renamed without a seg fault. The problem was a double-delete and was fixed by copying the variable. Switch to reference counter pointers.

2013-06-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added bind_name(). Still does not seem to work with a 'regular' variable. See bind_name_5.dods.bescmd.

2013-06-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added bind_name()

	Added make_array() function with tests. This version does not use custom argument parsing.

2013-06-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved the ResponseBuilder and ResponseCache classes to new names (BESDap...) so that the old code/classes could be put back in libdap - keeping the ABI constant if that's needed.

2013-06-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the .deps directory to svnignore

	Moved ResponseBuilder, ResponseChacne and DAPCache3 from libdap to this module. Cache location is now controlled by the bes.conf file.

	Added empty BES Keys file - could use /dev/null but using a real file that can be edited might be useful later on.

	Added unit tests for ResponseBuilder and ResponseCache to the bes/dap

2013-06-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	there's nothing in ce_functions.cc that's now compiled.

	More refactoring - headers reorganized; added VersionFunction and moved old stuff out of the way.

	Linear scale function refactored

	Refactor of grid().

	...forgot to the GeoGridFunction class built from the refactor

	Added data to tests.

	Refactor of GeoGrid complete.

	Refactor of GeoGrid's implementation.

2013-06-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added more tests - now geogrid and linear_scale and multiple functions in one CE are tested.

2013-06-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a test for the grid function.

	Added a simple kind of 'pattern' test to the new regression tests for functions. It uses grep...

	Initial version of regression tests added

	Branch for MIIC feature development
	A    https://scm.opendap.org/svn/branch/bes/miic_6.2013

2013-06-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2013-05-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for linux - CentOS 6 comes with gdal 1.7 but our code needs a newer version. I Hacked the ax_lib_gdal.m4 script so that it looks for the version of gdal and sets the GDAL variables to null if 1.10+ is not found (it was returning an error).

	comments

	Added files to the svn ignore property

	Excised the errant 'function_dap()' server function and added #include <util.h> to some unit tests. These changes were needed since the code moved here from it's former home in libdap.

	bes: Added configure options for valgrind

2013-05-15  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	bes: Adjusted production rules so that the Makefile for bes/functions/swath2grid is built, but refrained from addin swath2grid to the SUBDIRS var in bes/functions/Makefile.am. This means you can build it by hand but it's not built automagically.

	bes: Got unit tests working in bes/functions/unit-tests

	libdap: Moving trunk/libdap/unit-tests/ce-functions-testsuite to trunk/bes/functions/unit-tests because that's where the functions are that need the contents of that directory.

	Added a set_dds() method to BESDDSResponse and BESDataDDSResponse. This enables a handler to subclass the DDS/DataDDS and have the BES use that subclass.

2012-04-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed an issue in BESCache3 where files where not closed when a nonblocking lock could not be obtained on a file.

	Fixed the Makefile.am in bes/dispatch/unit-tests

2012-04-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tuning plus a fix for purging where files are not locked exclusively during the purge.

	BESCache3 improvements: Atomic shared and exclusive lock acquisition simplifies use; purge and cache info code now manages its own locks so the caller doesn't need to; shared locks used where they make sense. Passes tests. Fixed BESFileContainer.cc so that it uses a compile-time switch to choose between the original cache and the new one.

2012-04-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified the 'cache lock' so that it keeps the cache info (i.e. lock file) open for the duration and thus can use fcntl(2) atomically to set and release locks.

	Working; optimization to decompress values w/o the cache being locked works. Saves about 20% of time with four processes.

	Cleaned up the Cache3 code so that the old variants of lock-here versus lock-there are removed.

	This version of the code correctly handles the case where the cache is not locked during decompression. It works on both OSX and Linux. There's still room for improvement and performance tests, but this can be used.

	More changes; working on the deadlock issue that arises when the cache is unlocked during the decompression operations.

2012-04-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The fcntl(2) locking works on linux, but I found an issue with the uncompress functions - they close the dest file, which releases the lock. Modified the code for GZ and will do more testing.

	Updated for linux build
	M    dispatch/unit-tests/BESCache3Test.cc

	Problem in isLocked() fixed - was not closing file after testing.

	BESCache3 is fixed an optimized so that it does not lock the cache during the file decompression, which means it allows simultaneous decompressions and reads. The cache is locked during file lock acqusition and cache purge operations. Still more testing, however...

	BESCache3 works but still has to lock the entire cache for both the shared and exclusive lock access. Work on this; test on Linux.

2012-03-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESCache3 and BESUncompressManager3 appear to work now. They pass the same stress test that BESCache2 passes

2012-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	checkpoint

	Added BESCache3 because linux lacks the lock semantics of OS/X's open(2) system service. Must reimplement using fcntl...

	Added include for ostringstream

2012-03-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESCache2 tests OK. All that's left is a test on linux.

	BESCache2 compiles again.

	BESCache2 broken - checkpoint.

	Cache code appears to pass tests - 5 processes simultaneously accessing the cache 2000 times each where there are far more compressed files than will fit in the cache at one time (so there are lots of purge operations). There may be ways to improve its performance a bit...

2012-03-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Cache code. Testing, race condition with cache purging.

	some headway on the multiprocess tests...

	Fixed some minor issues in the cache code - unnecessary recalculation of sizes, normalized the cache to always use sizes in bytes but take configuration in sizes in megabytes, streamline error messages (need to check on that).

2012-03-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Improved cache purge code by changing the 'head room' param to 20%. Also fixed a problem where the megs versus bytes things were broken.

	BESCache2 might be working - single process tests appear to work; have not tried multiprocess tests yet. Must work on some other stuff for a bit...

	caching: basic tests pass

	Checkpoint...

	checkpoint - fixes for the file-descriptor unlock method. No tests yet...

2012-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	checkpoint for the BESCache2 code - not quite working...

2012-02-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the broken bes.pid file problem when using rpms. The problem was caused by having the besdaemon write the pid file after switching its UID from root. To fix this I changed when the pid file is written so that it is written by root. I aslo changed the directory where its written (likely not actually needed given the first change) so that the rpm-installed bes writes the pid file to /var/run/bes/bes.pid and the /var/run/bes dir is group writable by bes. This might be useful if the bes is ever run in developer mode from an RPM (unlikely, but...)

2012-02-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Version 3.10.1

	Moved the BES default port to 10022 to avoid conflicts on CentOS 6

2012-02-02  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

2011-10-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	In the bes/server code, I replaced the class 'XMLWriter' with BESXMLWriter to avoid confusion with libdap's XMLWriter class.

	Fixed an issue in BESDataRepsonseHandler where the new response size limit feature was broken when the special value of zero was used. Also, TheBESKeys is using an env var which is not really a great thing for server to be doing; I set things up so that we can switch that out in the future.

2011-07-29  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Version mod for PPT fix M    configure.ac M    NEWS M    ChangeLog M    bes.spec

	Using sizeof( eod_marker ), which is a char *. On 32 bit machines this will be 4 and on 64 bit machines 8. The correct value is 8 (by chance). Replaced with const size_t. M    ppt/PPTStreamBuf.cc

	Fix for using sizeof( char *eod_marker ), and replacing with const size_t value. M    ppt/PPTStreamBuf.cc

2011-07-21  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Repaired check of PS. M    server/besctl.in

2011-07-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This version builds and runs but I am getting some errors still...

	New, more efficient version of get_log_lines(). Untested.

2011-07-16  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Global initialization and terminiation functionality not being used and no longer needed. D    dispatch/BESInitOrder.h D    dispatch/BESInitList.h M    dispatch/BESBaseApp.cc D    dispatch/BESInitFuns.h D    dispatch/BESInitializer.h M    dispatch/Makefile.am D    dispatch/BESGlobalIQ.h D    dispatch/BESGlobalInit.h D    dispatch/BESGlobalIQ.cc D    dispatch/BESInitList.cc D    dispatch/unit-tests/TheCat.h D    dispatch/unit-tests/TheDog.h D    dispatch/unit-tests/TheCat.cc D    dispatch/unit-tests/TheFailedCat.cc D    dispatch/unit-tests/initT.cc D    dispatch/unit-tests/TheDog.cc D    dispatch/unit-tests/TheFailedCat.h M    dispatch/unit-tests/Makefile.am D    dispatch/BESGlobalInit.cc

2011-07-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Switched back to an older, less efficient, but also less buggy, function to read the last N log lines.

2011-07-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	minor change - there's an infinite loop in the code that gets log lines.

	Removed some debug commands that were just commented out; a few are still in the code in case ticket 1783 really is not fixed...

	Fix for ticket 1783. Using file descriptor 4 for the listener --> daemon IPC (a pipe) was a bad idea. I switched the code to used stdout and that fixed the probelm. See the commentary for ticket 1783 for all the gore.

	Fixes to the besdaemon/listener. Logging control now works, an issue with the tailLog command has been fixed and a problem with the error message about responses being too big has been addressed. There is a lingering issue with the daemon exiting with 'signal 13' that I think is still present.

2011-06-30  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Merge hyrax 1.7 branch to trunk

2011-06-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Performance improvements in the log scanning and tail feature.

	besdaemon now reads the config file names from the BES.Includes key. It also uses the log file name in place of the token "LOG" as the default sink for debug messages.

2011-06-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Minor fixes for bes debug/log 'set' command.

	Fixes for the debug/log stuff in the BES. The BES starts now... This may not be reading the commands yet, however.

2011-06-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Mid-point check-in; server works again and has half of the new option processing code.

2011-06-16  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Issues with building on Linux M    server/ServerApp.cc M    dispatch/BESCatalogUtils.cc

2011-06-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes/fixes for the get/set log contexts feature of the HAI. The code does not always work, but the server will not crash. Setting the besdaemon log/debug context will work - that is, the messages for besdaemon will show up in the bes.log file, so the HAI tail log command should get them. What won't work: Setting contexts like 'ascii' or 'h4'; probably starting the besdaemon using -d "cerr, ...".

2011-06-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Some fixes for the log contexts...

	The BES now supports get and set of logging contexts. Initial version.

	More changes to besctl

2011-06-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	One last feature for besctl.

	more fixes for besctl.

2011-06-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	comment and mini-help for pids and kill.

	Fixed the script (I broke it earlier). Added 'pids' and 'kill' commands. The pids command returns a list of all PIDS that have to do with the BES (listener and daemon). The kill command removes all of the processes using a signal that cannot be caught and then removes the PID file.

	Fixes for the CLOSE_WAIT bug. Now we can use the PPTServer class for 'stateless' servers. A client can connect, send a command and then close. Before this was causing the server to build up lots of 'used' sockets stuck in the CLOSE_WAIT state.

2011-06-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BES now has the max_response_size context.

2011-06-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for erratic behavior of start and stop - signals were being blocked and unblocked in odd ways. This lead to the besdaemon loosing information about the beslistener pid and to the OLFS getting an error message when there was no error.

2011-05-28  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Added static functions to explode a url into individual parts (protocol, domain, username, password, port, path including query string). Added a unit test for it. M    dispatch/BESUtil.cc M    dispatch/unit-tests/fsT.cc M    dispatch/unit-tests/Makefile.am A    dispatch/unit-tests/urlT.cc M    dispatch/BESUtil.h

2011-05-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a typo in The BESKeys.cc

2011-05-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added and then removed code to re-read the configuration file. It's better to restart the server and be sure that all of the initialization takes place.

	Added implementation of TailLog for the HAI contract.

	Most of SetConfig now works... files save, backup, etc. The module config files are a hack.

	Fixed error messages; SetConfig progress.

	Added support for the new new GetConfig command.

2011-05-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added initial/hacked support for config file retrieval. The GetConfig and GetConfig module="name" commands are now supported, although the latter is a hack.

	Fixed a situation where multiple start commands resulted in incorrect error messages. Command processing is now protected from signals.

2011-05-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updates to the error messages - fatals and user are not used more appropriately.

	besdaemon now handles multiple start commands without loosing the pid of the master beslistener that's actually running.

	Added note about using a pipe/fifo so that the master beslistener can tell the daemon it started and is running.

	Added initial version of beslistener tracking (is it running?) so that start is not run when the listener is already running. Another way to do this is to poll the BES listener port before the fork().

2011-05-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Completed the initial version of besdaemon/beslistener for the hai. This implements the start and stop feature using the besdaemon 'command interface'. The port on which the besdaemon listens is set in the bes.conf file using BESDaemonPort. Untested is support for unix sockets. If a value for DaemonPort is not given, the interface does not start. Regardless of whether the interface is used, the besdaemon will restart the beslisteners if it gets SIGHUP. Use -d "cerr,besdaemon" to get debugging output from the besdaemon.

	Update for HUP behavior

	M    server/daemon.cc
	M    server/ServerApp.cc
	M    server/Makefile.am
	M    dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in

	Fixed compile issue

	Added bes debug to daemon

2011-05-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Eh, the SIGHUP behavior is broken. Since it's not in the design, I've removed it.
	M    server/daemon.cc

	Minor fix - orig behavior where sending SIGHUP to the daemon forces a restart of the beslistener added back in.

	A class that is part of the hai interface - forgotten in the first commit.

	Support for teh HAI interface's most basic commands: It can start and stop the BES. The besdaemon runs all of the time; the beslistener is the component that the HAI starts and stops.

	Adding the xml document as the value of the set container to display to the log. M    xmlcommand/BESXMLSetContainerCommand.cc

2011-05-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for the Makefile.am; use mkdir -p in bes/bes.conf and bes/dap.conf because in a parallel build the test -d might both return false and then a bare mkdir bes can return an error (becase the other one ran after the test-d test failed. (NB: I removed the test -d).

2011-05-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2011-02-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hand-merged a patch from the trunk here, for the 1.6.3 release for BESPlugin.h (so that it does not unplug modules until the hdf4 handler bug is fixed).

	shrew: More updates to production rules

2011-02-08  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Support for the new ResponseBuilder class - this replaces DODSFilter, dropping that class' baggage from the CGI days and includes the ability to parse CE keywords (although we might not use this ultimately). Also, this checking includes a patch for the ticket 1710 where the hdf4 handler seems to have a memory bug that causes a seg fault when the handler is removed.

2011-02-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added d_lib = 0 to the code in BESPlugin.h that calls dlclose().

2011-02-03  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Removed, no longer used. D    csv-handler/dap_csv_handler.cc

	Reverse order in termination as was in initialization. Fixed a couple issues in BESRegex. ContainerStorageCatalog was calling include and exclude on a node when include already calls exclude internally. Converted CatalogUtils to use BESRegex instead of GNURegex from libdap. M    server/ServerApp.cc M    standalone/StandAloneApp.cc M    dispatch/BESRegex.cc M    dispatch/BESModuleApp.cc M    dispatch/BESCatalogUtils.cc M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.cc

2011-02-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed some old tests for avhrr data that will always fail because the data have moved.
	M    testsuite/besTest.at

	Patch for ticket 1702 - this patch is for the problem where modules don't 'unplug' correctly and sometimes crash the beslistener/besstandalone. It's not a fix, but the ncml_module now passes its tests.
	M    BESPlugin.h

	o Fix for newer GCC complaining about extra qualification in header for new func (can't put the classname scope operator in the declaration, only definition)

	Copied fix for non-purging 64 bit uncompress cache for ticket #1672 in changeset [23959] from trunk to release branch for creating RPM.

2010-12-29  Michael Johnson  <michael.patrick.johnson@gmail.com>

	o Fixes to make the cache work for caches sizes > 4Gb (i.e. 64 bit rather than 32 bit).  For ticket #1672.
	o Changes to the unit test are NOT on by default since they make a large test dir.  To run this test, one must do it by hand:  "dispatch/unit-tests/cacheT --do-64-bit-test"

	o dispatch/BESDapTransmit.cc: Changes for ticket #1574.  Refactor using file local class hierarchy to factor out common code.
	o Other files: elimination of compiler warnings, mostly signed/unsigned and unused parameters.

2010-07-13  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Allow for the multiple inclusion of a file without having it loaded twice. This way, module configurations can require another module to be loaded before itself. For example, the netcdf module can require that the dap module be loaded first.
	Fixed a bug in file inclusion using regular expressions where was
	matching files that started with the file name. So including dap.conf
	would include dap.conf.sav, which would lead to loading dap module
	multiple times.

	If the BES needs to exit (Internal Fatal Error) then it was sending the error response, and then trying to send an exit to the client. But the client wouldn't be listening anymore, it might be trying to send. Cleaned this up so that the BES would set the status to error, and set exit to true in the chunk extensions. The client should respond accordingly. M    server/BESServerHandler.cc M    cmdln/CmdClient.cc M    cmdln/CmdApp.cc M    cmdln/CmdClient.h

The libdap software has had a number of the FILE* methods/functions commented out using #if FILE_METHODS and then #undef FILE_METHODS. We'll see how much of the redundant code can be removed before the next Hyrax 1.6 release.

Since we're returning XML documents built with libxml2, they aren't very pretty. This makes them pretty for interactive and commandline view.

	After implementing new xml request documents, the bescmdln interactive and -x command line option required the user to input xml documents to be sent to the server. This code allows the user input the old string commands and have them translated into xml documents using libxml2. Moved BESTokenizer from command to dispatch so that other utilities could use it. Added CmdTranslation to cmdln along with unit tests for it. This allows a caller to add translation functions to CmdTranslation similar to being able to add commands to the BES. Need to still implement a way to allow developers to add commands without modifying the code. Perhaps loading a module in like in the BES.

	Added the ability for a request handler to have a catch all function for responses based on containers such as get das, get dds, get ascii, etc... This catch all function would not be for help or version responses. Added this in preparation for aggregation. M    dispatch/BESRequestHandlerList.cc M    dispatch/BESDataHandlerInterface.cc M    dispatch/BESDataHandlerInterface.h M    dispatch/BESRequestHandler.h

	Make sure RESPONSE_TYPES is set to the empty string if "none" is specified. M    besCreateModule.in

	The version reported was for the BES package. Changed to pptcapi M    pptcapi-config.in

2008-08-15  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	tcp window tuning is now provided in the tcp connection call. The user is allowed to set the tcp window sizes for buffer sizes by passing the receive and send buffer sizes to the tcp connection call. The system call setsockopt is used to set the buffer sizes on the connection socket. If set to 0 then the current buffer sizes are used by calling getsockopt.
	Added debugging calls to the code, user can now turn on and turn off
	debugging if desired.

	Fixed the problem where the receive chunk size is bigger than the receive
	buffer size while creating a static buffer to use in the receive calls. This
	will eliminate fragmentation caused by allocating new buffers for each call
	to receive.

2008-07-15  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Removed the declaration of initialize connection struct function from pptcapi as it is an internal function.

M    pptcapi/pptcapi_tcp_connect.c M    pptcapi/pptcapi_socket_connect.c M    pptcapi/pptcapi.h

	Updated to use 7 characters for chunk length. Fixed problem where receive was using a buffer too small in the call to read. The buffer is now dynamically created depending on the chunk size. Updated the test results because problem fixed in BES data handlers where ancillary data wasn't being read. Modified the send and receive code to use macro definitions of the chunk so that all we have to do is change the macro definitions in pptcapi.h and won't have to go through the code to update (except in pptcapi_send where building the chunk header).

	For machines that need unistd.h need to make sure HAVE_UNISTD_H is defined, so include config.h before the c includes. M    dispatch/BESUtil.cc

	Moved fastpidconverter from BESProcIdResponseHandler to BESUtil. Added one that calls getpid itself instead of requiring the caller to do it. Added the pid to the beginning of any BESDEBUG calls. Any calls to BESDEBUG that did not end with endl I added an endl. To see BESDEBUG calls for a particular process do: grep <pid> bes.debug.

	Cleaned up warnings about not declared functions malloc and sprintf M    pptcapi_authenticate.c

	Debug was broken. When modules registered their debug name it was set to false, i.e. the module debuggiing was turned off, even if all was set. So, when a module is registered, if all is set then the module debugging is turned on, else it is turned off. Also, if debug mode all is set then all currently registered debug modules are turned on. Order matters when setting up debugging. For example, -d "bes.debug,-bes,all" eventually turns the bes module debugging on. To turn off bes use -d "bes.debug,all,-bes". M    server/ServerApp.cc M    dispatch/BESDebug.cc M    dispatch/BESDebug.h

2008-01-25  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	New exception/error processing and responses have been added to the BES. Instead of many different inherited classes of BESException there is now the BESError class with the inherited classes BESInternalFatalError, BESInternalError, BESSyntaxUserError, BESForbiddenError, and BESNotFoundError. If the fatal error is thrown then the BES will exit. Check the BESError class for the error type numbers. The errors no longer have context information, as it was deemed unnecisary. The XML document returned will have the tag <BESError> instead of <BESException>. Please see the trac documentation for more information.
	Also in this check in is new symbolic link functionality. In the BES
	configuration file are the new parameters BES.*.FollowSymLinks=No|Yes If set
	to yes, then container and catalog requests will follow symbolic links
	relative to the document root. If set to no, then we won't follow symbolic
	links.

	Set container calls will throw an exception now if the container is not
	valid, does not exist, contains a symbolic link in the relative path to the
	document root if FollowSymLinks is set to no.

	Show catalog requests of collections will return the contents of the
	collection in alphabetical order.

	Few more changes for 3.5.2 M    ChangeLog

2007-11-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	hyraxctl.in: I've fixed this so that it works on FC6/64-bit.

	I added "" to line: if [ ! -z "$CHECK_PID" ] around $CHECK_ID since that's what the -z operator expects (as string). This fixes ticket #997.

2007-11-12  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Added hyraxctl and besregtest to the .spec file. M    bes.spec

	3.5.2 release file updates M    ChangeLog M    bes.spec M    configure.ac M    NEWS

	Switched order of checking for PS, starting with UCB and then System V. procps doesn't like the set up of the System V check, but the check passes, but doesn't give the results we want. Checking for the UCB version of ps works for procps. M    server/besctl.in M    server/hyraxctl.in

	bes; Updated hyraxctl script to use sudo to control the BES

2007-11-02  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Moved hyrax script to hyraxctl
	BES now must run as root, and the main listener sets the uid and gid to what is specified in the BES configuration file by BES.User and BES.Group.

	bes: Updated test baselinges

	Redirecting errors to /dev/null as well as standard output. M    server/besctl.in

2007-10-30  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	More adjustments to the start of the BES.
	1. Changed besctl script to check for the BES command line options. Any
	changes here need to be made in daemon.cc and ServerApp.cc as well. If the
	-i option is NOT passed to the script then we set -i to be the prefix used
	when running configure and pass it on to the daemon. If the -c option is NOT
	passed to the script then we set -c to be the -i option if specified plus
	/etc/bes/bes.conf, or to the BES_CONF environment variable.

	2. Updated BESServerUtils::show_usage to include the -i options, specifying
	the BES installation directory.

	3. Updated ServerApp.cc to look for the configuration file in -c location,
	then BES_CONF location, then in the directories
	/user/local/etc/bes/bes.conf, then /etc/bes/bes.conf, then
	/usr/etc/bes/bes.conf.

	4. Updated daemon.cc to use the -i option to look for the listener
	executable and the pid file (already doing this). If -i not specified then
	use the path to the daemon executable from argv[0]. If no path then look in
	the current working directory.

	5. Updated server/Makefile.am to not pass any -D options when building. This
	cleans up the package build targets.

	M    server/BESServerUtils.cc

2007-10-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a few words to the help line regarding options
	M besctl.in

	I changed how the CheckPS function workes - it now tests for the system v version of ps first and does not use a dash when testing for the UCB version.
	M besctl

2007-10-29  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Added check for /usr/etc/bes/bes.conf M    dispatch/TheBESKeys.cc

	No longer using BES_CONF_DIR variable from Makefile to determine locaiton of bes.conf. First uses -c option if specified, then BES_CONF environment variable if set, and finally checks for /usr/local/etc/bes/bes.conf and then /etc/bes/bes.conf. M    dispatch/Makefile.am M    dispatch/TheBESKeys.cc

2007-10-26  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	templates/bes.conf, moved the help information to the bottom with a comment to add Sample Module parameters there. templates/RequestHandler.cc, the contents of the file need to be wrapped in a tag. dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in, the help parameters for html files was incorrect. Changed from HTTP to HTML. Re-wrote the hello_world example with added information in the README of how to write the sample in a separate directory.

	bes: Addd hyrax control script

2007-10-25  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	TypeMatch checking now checks the full path of the file/directory, not just the basename. This way we can use path checking in the regular expressions for handlers such as jgofs, where data files do not have an extension. Also checking for an exact match rather than just partial match or more.
	Corrected the bes.conf file TypeMatch example.

	Ending debug statement in initialize added Done. M    csv-handler/CSVModule.cc

2007-10-09  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Multiple catalogs now works. If there is more than one catalog registered then the request must include the name of the catalog followed by a colon. For example: show catalog for "nc_catalog:/"; If there is only one catalog then works as before.
	Added ability to display all debug information. If "all" context is set in BESDebug then show any BESDEBUG statements.

	Removed use of help file, only adding usual information in help. Created data directory and moved temperature.csv there. Changed Makefile.am to install the data file into the share/hyrax/data/csv data directory. Added a bes.conf update script, as in the other handlers.

	Modifications to be able to write all response objects out to ostream rather than stdout. Beginnings of chunking. Modified unit tests and added new ones to test the funcionality. In PPT making sure that handshaking at beginning of connection is done directly to socket instead of using send and receive methods on PPTConnection, which will be changed to do chunking. The handshaking will NOT do chunking but will simply be tokens.

Also changed the constructors to take a const string & instead of a string. Also changed the constructors for the RequestHandler classes to take const string & instead of string. Changed the methods in ResponseHandler and RequestHandler classes when adding handlers to take const string & instead of string.
	Changed all the files to correct a typo in the copyright notice.

2007-05-31  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	f bz2 library not found now it will throw a runtime error instead of doing nothing. Before if a bz2 file was passed it would simply be passed to the data handler, where it would throw an error saying it can't open the bz2 file. Now, if bz2 is not compiled in an error will be thrown saying can't uncompress a bz2 file. M    Makefile.am M    BESUncompressManager.cc M    BESUncompressBZ2.h M    BESUncompressBZ2.cc

	BESCache is created to be able to tell whether a src file is cached, returning the target file, and implements purging of the cache. BES.CacheDir must be set in the bes configuration file along with BES.CachePrefix and BES.CacheSize. Added a unit test. This is not yet integrated into the dispatch code. This is a break point.

	Now can start up the server with either the port, the unix socket, or both. M    server/ServerApp.cc

	Just as in creating a container, we will not allow a user to specify ../ in the node name in a show catalog or show info command. M    dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.cc

2007-05-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated 3 May 2007.

	Added notes to the BES.

2007-05-01  Jose garcia  <jgarcia@ucar.edu>

	added svn propedit svn:ignore . so it stops svn status bugging with irrelevant files

2007-04-25  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Ability to execute a request handler with respect to only the current container. M    BESRequestHandlerList.h M    BESRequestHandlerList.cc

2007-04-23  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Added ability to repeat the command(s). Used mainly for testing purposes. Use the -r <num> option to repeat num times. M    cmdln/CmdClient.cc M    cmdln/CmdApp.cc M    cmdln/CmdClient.h M    cmdln/CmdApp.h

2007-04-19  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	In the vl_lib_readline.m4 file, last section, need to have LIBS set to READLINE_LIBS to test the history functions. In CmdClient.cc need to check to see if HAVEHISTORY is set before calling the function add_history. M    conf/vl_lib_readline.m4 M    cmdln/CmdClient.cc

	Corrected comment regarding syntax of set context call. Wasn't including the token 'to' ... set context <name> to <value>; M    BESSetContextCommand.cc

	Setting READLINE_LIBS instead of changing LIBS. The readline macro also checks for a termcap (or ncurses or curses) and adds it to READLINE_LIBS. So we don't need a separate check for termcap. M    cmdln/Makefile.am M    configure.ac

	Set READLINE_LIBS instead of changing libs. This way the bes libraries won't be depending on readline, only cmdln. M    conf/vl_lib_readline.m4

2007-04-18  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Redirected informational object was not being deleted in the destructor M    dispatch/BESVersionInfo.cc

	Removed debug printouts M    ppt/TcpSocket.cc

	Default modules were not being cleaned up. Then again ... the terminate method never gets called, which is a problem. M    server/ServerApp.cc

2007-04-12  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	%F not supported on all systems for displaying date information, so went %with the longhand %Y-%m-%d format, which %F represented. M    dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.cc

2007-04-10  Jose garcia  <jgarcia@ucar.edu>

	Added code to deal with the case when the connect call returns zero meaning that the socket is indeed connected immediately even in the case of non-blocking sockets. This behavior is observed in Solaris 10 but not in Mac OS X and Linux where those kernels are implemented in such way that connect *typically* return -1 which means that you must complete the connect call by a select call.

2007-04-06  Stephan Zednik  <zednis2@rpi.edu>

	Added call to PPTClient* client shutdown and destructor methods prior to calling exit( ) in CmdApp.cc SIGPIPE handler.

2007-04-05  Stephan Zednik  <zednis2@rpi.edu>

	modified string copy from _tempSocket and _serverSocket to use strncpy( ) and to only copy a string the size of the path opposed to a static length.

	Updated the connect( ) method of TcpSocket to immediately check whether a socket is fully connected.  The socket is set to non-blocking prior to calling connect(2).  connect(2) returns EINPROGRESS if the socket is not yet fully connected.  select(2) and getsockopt(2) are used with a 5 second timeout to test for a completed full connection.  If a full connection is established _connected is set to true, else a SocketException is thrown.  Before exit of method the socket is returned to its original blocking mode.

2007-04-05  Jose garcia  <jgarcia@ucar.edu>

	Fixed ticket 885

	Added guards and make the buffer size a define in order to use in the implementation file.

2007-04-04  Jose garcia  <jgarcia@ucar.edu>

	Fixed memory leak in receive, see ticket 879. Probably it will be better to use an BESAutoPtr to deal with how to delete the memory in those cases when exceptions are thrown.

2007-04-04  Stephan Zednik  <zednis2@rpi.edu>

	Modified the PPTClient constructor that uses a TCP Socket to set _connected to the result of a _mySock->isConnected() check rather then just to true.

2007-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a bes configuration test target so that the new configuration test script will work.
	M    Makefile.am

	The besctl command now checks to see that it can writing into the var/run directory before starting the server.
	M    server/besctl.in

	Modified Makefile.am so that the 'configuration' tests are not run using 'make check'. Instead there's a special target which can be run later.
	M    cmdln/Makefile.am

	Instead of just unescaping the constraint, unescape the entire request command. This way we'll catch any escaped characters in the request. M    bes/server/BESServerHandler.cc M    bes/command/BESDefineCommand.cc

2007-03-09  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Only check for the ssl certificate and key files if we are a secure connection.
	If an application connected to the BES but does not send the
	PPT_TESTING_CONNECTION string, then the BES was hanging. Using a timeout for
	the initial handshake.

	If a client connects to the BES that is not a BES client, and sends a string
	other then PPT_TESTING_CONNECTION, then we simply want to close the
	connection and return rather than throwing an exception and exiting.

	Updated and changed the names of some of the documents available for the BES. Added a document for the BES configuration information that can be referenced by all the other documents.
	Added the hello_world module example under the bes so that people can see
	how one could write a module. Another example would be a new data handler
	module that reads csv files.

2007-02-07  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Added information about configuring the BES in the bes.conf file, about how to start and stop the BES, and a note about what it means to stop the BES, that only the main listener and the daemon are stopped. Any listeners currently connected to clients will not be stopped in multiple mode. M    INSTALL

	Adding it back. A    dispatch/BESDapHandlerException.h

	For some reason svn thinks that the file has a lower case h instead of an upper case H. Trying to clean that up. D    http://scm.opendap.org:8090/svn/trunk/bes/dispatch/BESDapHandlerException.h

2007-02-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed. This file is a duplicate of BESDapHandlerException.h except for the name (lowercase 'H' in the file name). These case collisions confuse OS/X.
	D    dispatch/BESDaphandlerException.h

2007-02-07  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Not sure where this came from, but there were two 'const' tags at the end of one of the methods. M    cmdln/CmdClient.cc

	Added the commands 'set context <name> to <value>;' and 'show context;'. The first command allows the client to set a context in the BES. The reason for this is to allow errors to be dumped back as dap2 errors, so the caommand would be 'set context errors to dap2;'. The show command will respond with the list of context name/value pairs currently set in the BES.
	Modified the Exception classes to contain return codes, instead of having
	these used around the code. Also, a context is set within the exception
	classes. This cleans up the BESExceptionManager. Instead of trying to
	dynamically cast the exception classes to see which one it is to set the
	context and return the correct return code, it's all in the exception class.
	This way, users can create new BESException classes without adding exception
	callbacks.

	Created a new dap handler exception that contains Error class inforamtion,
	including the ErrorCode. The BESDapModule now adds an exception callback to
	handle the specific case where the error context is set to dap2. When this
	happens an Error object is created and dumped to stdout.

	Flushed out a bit more of the secure server development using ssl. The paths to the certificate and key file is specified in the bes configuration file. Can also specify what secure port to use in the server, defaults to 10003. Changed debugging in the SSL classes to use BESDEBUG.

	Fixed the issue in the Filter transmitter (the transmitter that uses a dods filter) where the static send functions were not being registered. Only the send_html and send_text methods are on a transmitter. All other transmit functions are registered static functions for the transmission of other respoonse objects.
	Also modified the response objects for DAS, DDS, and DataDDS to dump the
	actual DAS, DDS, and DataDDS objects in the dump method and not just
	pointers to the objects.

	Also fixed an issue where if a transmitter is not registered to transmit a
	given response object, nothing was happening. If there isn't a registered
	transmit function then an exception is thrown.

2006-12-29  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	dap_help.html and dap_help.txt were not being included in the release. M    dispatch/Makefile.am

	Preparing the BES for 3.3.1 release. M    ChangeLog M    bes.spec M    configure.ac M    INSTALL M    NEWS

2006-12-28  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Changed some tests in bes/cmdln/testsuit/show and bes/cmdln/testsuit/show/ssfunc to use match for improved portability

2006-12-27  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	BES: Updated tests after repair of bug 754

2006-12-26  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Was not reading in the end of the buffer properly and not checking for the termination properly. Pulled the MarkerFinder class from server4 java code and converted it to C++. Works like a charm. A    ppt/PPTMarkFinder.cc A    ppt/PPTMarkFinder.h M    ppt/PPTConnection.cc M    ppt/Makefile.am

2006-12-21  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Updated tests and added server side function tests to bescmdln

2006-12-20  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

2006-12-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESDDXResponseHandler.cc: Fixed ticket 753. Attributes were appearing twice in the DDX. This was do to a failure to communicate... Code in BESDDXResquestHandler built the DDX using the handler's code to build the DDS and DAS, but in the time since this (BESDDXReq...) was written the handlers have all been changed so that the DDS already contains attributes. So when this code added them, it was adding a second copy. This code has been modified to just use the DDS that comes from the handler.

2006-12-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes to the formatting for some files in dispatch and some new text in the top level README. The formatting changes are the result of some subtle changes in my Eclipse settings and using spaces instead of tabs (which makes the formatting no longer dependent on the tabs setting of any editor).

	BESDapTransmit.cc: Fixed ticket 710. The code for send_basic_ddx() was not trapping the Error objects from DODSFilter::send_ddx() and recasting them in a BESException object, hence the unknown exception error.

	BESDDXResponseHandler.cc: Removed call to dump.

	BESDebug.h: Fixed some warnings about return types and control reaching the end of non-void functions (begin_ and end_debug).

2006-12-07  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	BES: Added escape handling to BESTokenizer

2006-12-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

2006-12-05  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Added call to make sure the real name is on the include list as well as not being on the exclude list. M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.cc

	If someone tries to create a container in the catalog framework with a real_name that is on the exclude list then an exception is thrown. M    dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.h A    dispatch/BESCatalogUtils.h M    dispatch/Makefile.am M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.h A    dispatch/BESCatalogUtils.cc M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.cc M    dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.cc

	Closing the connection if establishing the connection fails. The connectiono could have been established, but a problem occurred afterwords. So close the connection. M    CmdApp.cc

	Removed debug statements that were being displayed when closing a connection. M    daemon.cc

2006-12-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	bescmdln: repaired freeform test baseline

2006-12-03  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Moved the usage and version code to another class to be shared by the daemon and the listener. Added a -h option for help. A    server/BESServerUtils.cc M    server/daemon.cc A    server/BESServerUtils.h M    server/Makefile.am M    server/ServerApp.cc M    server/ServerApp.h

	If requesting version then the daemon doesn't try to start the listener. Fixed the problem where if you specify -d and then another option without specifying a debug option, then an error is displayed and the usage is displayed. The version displayed now uses the PACKAGE macros from the config file. M    server/daemon.cc M    server/ServerApp.cc

2006-12-01  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	With the addition of the parameter BES.Data.RootDirectory, the results of adding a container are a bit different. Just had to adjust the test to meet the new requirements for containers. M    test/testsuite/dispatch.0/pvolT.exp M    test/pvolT.cc M    test/persistence_cgi_test.ini

2006-11-30  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

2006-11-29  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Replaced hard coded buffer sizes with macro M    bes/dispatch/BESInfo.cc M    bes/dispatch/BESContainer.cc M    bes/dispatch/BESStreamResponseHandler.cc M    bes/ppt/PPTClient.cc M    bes/ppt/PPTServer.cc M    bes/ppt/PPTConnection.cc M    bes/ppt/PPTProtocol.h

	If the token after "with" in a define command is not c.constraint= or c.attributes= where c is the container name from a set command, then the parser would crash. The problem was that the result from a std::string find method was being compared to 0 rather than string::npos. M    command/BESTokenizer.cc

2006-11-27  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Removed debug statements from exclude code M    bes/dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.cc

	If the node being requested is a directory and is in the exclude list, then return an error message. If the node being requested is a file and is not in the include list or is in the exclude list, then return an error message. Only if the node being requested can be included will the information be returned. This already worked for sub nodes. M    bes/dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.h M    bes/dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.cc

2006-11-24  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	../ not allowed when creating a container. This will prevent people from trying to find files they shouldn't be looking at, keeping their containers restricted to below the root directory. M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageVolatile.cc

	createServer script is up to date with the latest bes.conf file. Added dump methods to the response and request handlers and the module class. M    bes/templates/ResponseHandler.cc M    bes/templates/ResponseHandler.h M    bes/templates/_commands.cc D    bes/templates/opendap.ini M    bes/templates/Module.cc M    bes/templates/RequestHandler.cc M    bes/templates/Module.h M    bes/templates/RequestHandler.h A    bes/templates/bes.conf M    bes/bin/createServer

	Added BES.Data.RootDirectory key to bes configuration file. Before anyone was able to look at any file on the system. For example, a user could have said 'set container values c,/etc/passwd,txt;define d as c;get stream for d;' and gotten back the /etc/passwd file. Now a root directory is used to make sure that only the data under the root directory is searched. M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageVolatile.h M    dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.h M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.cc M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageVolatile.cc

	All classes in BES now inherit from the same parent, BESObj. BESObj has a dump method on it that allows, during debug, for an object's state to be dumped (private data members, whatever else). Also on the BESObj class is a operator<< method so that you can have an object, called obj, and do the following: cout << obj ; Created a BESIndent class so that dumps can be indented nicely for easier debugging.
	Created a BESDebug class and the beginnings of debug information throughout
	the code. The -d option on the command line client and the server (including
	the besctl script) now work. The options takes an argument, either cerr (to
	dump debug information to cerr) or the name of a file where debug
	information will be sent.

	The -t options on the command line client (and in the PPT client code) is
	now working. Before we accepted the flag, but ignored it.

	In the command line client the usage information is only dumped once. And,
	if version is requested, the usage is NOT dumped after the version
	information is dumped.

	Removed any reference to key/value pairs in the BES configuration file that
	had OPeNDAP at the front and any error messages that reference them. They
	all begin with BES.

	Added

	Fixes, hacks, et cetera

	Removed blank line, which brke this test.

2006-11-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	common_tests.exp: Added

2006-11-16  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	The purpose of the initT test program is to make sure that global objects are being created in the proper order. Both TheCat and TheDog were being initiatlized at level 1. Changed TheCat to be initialized at level 2 after TheDog is initialized. M    TheCat.cc

2006-11-07  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Building on Solaris 10, readline is not installed by default and the extern declarations in CmdClient.cc had incorrect signatures. M    bes/cmdln/CmdClient.cc

	The function sys_errlist does not exist on all machines. Created a sys_errlist.m4 file in the conf directory to determine if it is available. If it is available then use it. If not, then use strerror. A    bes/conf/sys_errlist.m4 M    bes/ppt/SSLServer.cc M    bes/configure.ac

2006-11-06  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Default is that if --with-openssl is NOT specified and cannot be found on the system then OpenSSL is not used. If --without-openssl is specified then OpenSSL is not used. If either --with-openssl is specified, --with-openssl is NOT specified nor is --without-openssl and openssl is found then it is used. M    bes/conf/openssl.m4

	--without-openssl now works correctly. If --without-openssl is specified then openssl is not looked for in the system. If nothing is specified when running configure (no --with-openssl or --without-openssl) then openssl is looked for. If not found an error is reported and the configure fails. If it is found then we continue. If --without--openssl is specified, then the ssl classes in ppt are not built and the code doing authentication is ifdef'd out. M    bes/conf/openssl.m4 M    bes/ppt/PPTServer.h M    bes/ppt/PPTClient.cc M    bes/ppt/PPTServer.cc M    bes/ppt/Makefile.am

2006-11-03  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Added an option to get dap dependent bes libraries. To be used by an modules that require libdap. M    bes-config.in

	Moved the container and definition commands back to the default list of commands instead of part of the dap module. M    command/Makefile.am

	Added the dl library dependency to the configure script since we are not building with the libdap libraries, which had dl as part of its libs list. M    configure.ac

	Once you get back a module object from the plugin factory it can be deleted after use. So, in the initialization and in the termination method, delete the module object returned by get. It is created each time. M    BESModuleApp.cc

	Changed rem_command to del_command to have it delete the command (if not the TermCommand) from the list instead of just returning it and requiring the user to delete the command. Moved the container and definition commands back to the default command list instead of the dap command list. M    command/opendap_commands.cc M    command/BESCommand.h M    command/BESCommand.cc M    command/DAPCommandModule.cc

	util.h was being included from libdap, but is no longer needed. M    dispatch/BESVersionResponseHandler.cc

	Removed libdap dependence from dispatch library, making libdap dependence and the building of dap_module and bes_dap libraries optional in dispatch. Removed any dependencies in source files for libdap code. M    bes/cmdln/CmdApp.cc M    bes/configure.ac M    bes/server/ServerApp.cc M    bes/command/BESParserException.cc M    bes/command/Makefile.am

	The core BES code no longer depends on libdap. Changed the Makfile to check if the dap-config script exists. If it does, then build the dap_module library and the new library bes-dap. If not, just build the dispatch library. Created a new parent class for response objects BESResponseObject, which used to be in libdap and called DODSResponseObject. Created classes to represent DAS, DDS, DataDDS in BES, called BESDASResponse, BESDDSResponse and BESDataDDSResponse. Created a dap request handler that handles the building of help information for dap requests and version information. Changed the container compression routine to look for a list of compression extensions (default gz, bz2, and Z) instead of a regular expression. Removed the debug flag from the App class until we can get a debug class implemented. Any Error exceptions need to be caught in the data handlers and converted to BESHandlerException (the non-fatal exception). No Error exceptions are caught in the core BES.

2006-10-14  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Changed 'get file' command to 'get stream' command.

	Feature 42 2b implemented, isData flag set in catalog display to let client know that the node has responses associated with it. Also began implementing 2c of feature 42, which will return the different response types for the node. M    dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.h M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.h M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.cc M    dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.cc

2006-10-13  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	If successfully deleted all definitions then need to return true. Was returning nothing. M    BESDefinitionStorageVolatile.cc

2006-10-12  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Added 'get file' request as default command. Uses the BESGetCommand class to build the request. Also cleaned up some includes.:q M    dispatch/BESDDXResponseHandler.cc AM   dispatch/BESFileResponseHandler.h M    dispatch/default_module.cc M    dispatch/BESDataResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESCatalogResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/Makefile.am AM   dispatch/BESFileResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESProcIdResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESHelpResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESResponseNames.h M    dispatch/BESDASResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESDataNames.h M    dispatch/BESDDSResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESExceptionManager.cc M    dispatch/BESInterface.cc M    dispatch/BESTextInfo.cc

2006-09-25  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	BESHeapManager had a static singleton, so one was being created. The constructor was setting the current limit and max limit to 3 megabytes. So, when a user set the max heap to more than 3 meg, and wasn't running bes as root, the bes would fail. Most systems, the max is infinate, so that the user can set a max without throwing an exception. M    dispatch/BESMemoryGlobalArea.cc M    dispatch/Makefile.am D    dispatch/BESHeapManager.cc D    dispatch/BESHeapManager.h

2006-09-21  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Using createServer, just build the new BES module. If the user wants an old style cgi app then they can add it. Updated the code to use the latest code. M    templates/ResponseHandler.cc M    templates/conf/bes.m4 D    templates/_handler.cc D    templates/HandlerApp.cc M    templates/configure.ac D    templates/HandlerApp.h D    templates/config M    templates/Makefile.am M    templates/Module.cc M    templates/RequestHandler.cc M    templates/Module.h M    bin/createServer

2006-09-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	bes.spec: Removed some of the Required programs used for compression since these are really not required for all uses. configure.ac: Bumped up the bes rev to 3.2.1 for these changes Makefile.am: Minor changes to formatting NEWS: Added the usual types of comments...

2006-09-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	testsuite: Added. Not functional; waiting on the results of a ticket regarding the -i option to bescmdln.

2006-09-19  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	If readline returns a null buffer then this means an EOF was reached, so we're done. It's like typing exit. Changed readLine method to return -1 if EOF is reached and check for that when calling readLine. M    CmdClient.cc

	debugging messages were left in the code. Removed. M    CmdApp.cc

2006-09-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	in dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in: Changed lone 'hdf4' to 'h4' to make all comments match.

	Added testsuite directory with five sample files. This could become the basis for a bes testsuite based on DejaGNU.

2006-09-16  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	spec updated with new bes and besd exec names, which are beslistener and besdaemon. libtestmodule, built in server/test, is now built as part of make check instead of the regular build. M    bes.spec M    server/test/Makefile.am

	Updates for release 3.2.0 to ChangeLog, README, and NEWS files. M    ChangeLog M    README M    NEWS

	Changed the sys admin email to not use angle brackets so if a user doesn't change it it doesn't mess up any xml responses. Did the same for all other paramers, just in case. Updated the documentation adding more information for some parameters. M    bes/bes.conf.in

2006-09-15  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Little tweaks to the expected output of the tests. Also, parameters in the keys files have changed names and weren't being reflected here. M    test/containerT.cc M    test/testsuite/dispatch.0/initT.exp M    test/testsuite/dispatch.0/infoT.exp M    test/testsuite/dispatch.0/keysT.exp M    test/testsuite/dispatch.0/pfileT.exp M    test/info_test.ini M    test/empty.ini M    test/persistence_file_test.ini M    test/keysT.cc M    test/infoT.cc M    test/Makefile.am

	Module libraries are created with -module option and without version information. Docs directory now has a makefile in it so that documentation is included in the release. doxygen information is now included in the release, although the comments in the code need to be updated. bes renamed to beslistener. besd renamed to besdaemon. libraries renamed to have bes_ in their names. M    bes-config.in A    docs/Makefile.am M    cmdln/Makefile.am M    dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in M    dispatch/Makefile.am A    bes.spec M    configure.ac M    ppt/Makefile.am M    server/test/Makefile.am M    server/besctl.in M    server/daemon.cc M    server/Makefile.am M    doxy.conf M    Makefile.am M    command/Makefile.am

	Fixed problem where the PPT_COMPLETE_DATA_TRANSMITION token was split between to reads of the buffer. This meant that the token is written to the stream instead of being recognized as the end of the transmission. M    ppt/PPTConnection.cc

	Cleaning up un-needed includes and comments M    dispatch/BESVersionInfo.cc M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.cc

2006-09-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESPlugin.h: Changed RTLD_GLOBAL to RTLD_LOCAL in th dlopen() call. This should prevent symbol clashes between two modules. That is, the global symbols of one module will not be used to resolve references in a second module. See ticket #469.

2006-09-06  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	help file location incorrect in the bes.conf.in file, updated. Added the uncomnpress and purge scripts .in files to the extra distribution files and the scripts themselves to the distribution clean directive. M    bes/bes.conf.in M    Makefile.am

2006-09-05  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	The transmitter was not being set early enough in the process of handling a request. if an exception was thrown then it was possible to not have a transmitter set. It's still possible, if an exception is thrown during startup, but setting the transmitter to either basic or http is being done much sooner. During the build phase it is possible to replace the transmitter with one set in the request, such as using a 'return as' command in a get. M    command/BESCmdInterface.cc

	Allow any registered exception handlers handle displaying administrator information the way they want. Delay adding this information until after iterating through the registered handlers

	send_html in BESbassicHttpTransmitter.cc was calling send_text in the parent class instead of send_html

	error message in BESLog refers to keys that begin with OPeNDAP. Changed to refer to BES.LogName

2006-09-01  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	The uncompress script now purges the cache directory using a cache max size that is passed in. I am using the purge_cache perl routine from DODS_Cache.pm in dap-server, with some modifications. The configure now looks for gzip, bzip2, and perl and sets them correctly in the two scripts bes-uncompress.sh and bes-purge.pl. Create .in files to do this and modified the Makefile.am in dispatch to generate the two scripts. Modified BESContainer to look for the key in bes.conf BES.CacheDir.MaxSize, which defaults to 500 MB, and pass that cache size to the uncompress script. AM   dispatch/bes-uncompress.sh.in M    dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in M    dispatch/Makefile.am M    dispatch/BESContainer.h M    dispatch/BESContainer.cc AM   dispatch/bes-purge.pl.in D    dispatch/bes-uncompress.sh M    configure.ac

	Made configuration updates per Patrice Dumas. Changed the transmitter code to only be able to send BESInfo objects. Added function list where developers can add transmit functions to the different transmitter. Created BESDapTransmit to hold the libdap response objects transmit functions (send_basic_das and send_http_das for example). M    bes-config.in A    dispatch/BESDapModule.h D    dispatch/BESModule.h M    dispatch/BESDDXResponseHandler.cc A    dispatch/BESDapModule.cc M    dispatch/BESBasicTransmitter.cc M    dispatch/BESDataResponseHandler.cc A    dispatch/BESTransmitter.cc M    dispatch/BESBasicHttpTransmitter.cc M    dispatch/BESModuleApp.cc M    dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in M    dispatch/Makefile.am M    dispatch/BESTransmitterNames.h M    dispatch/BESBasicTransmitter.h D    dispatch/BESModule.cc A    dispatch/BESDapTransmit.cc M    dispatch/BESBasicHttpTransmitter.h M    dispatch/BESDASResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESModuleApp.h M    dispatch/BESDDSResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESTransmitter.h A    dispatch/BESDapTransmit.h M    dispatch/BESExceptionManager.cc M    configure.ac M    server/test/Makefile.am M    server/besctl.in M    server/daemon.cc M    server/Makefile.am M    NEWS M    command/Makefile.am

2006-08-25  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Missing end quote around the name of the container. M    BESDelContainersResponseHandler.cc

2006-08-24  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	If the bes daemon fails to start for some reason then no pid file is created, so can't cat it. Check to see if the pid file exists. If it does, then the bes started successfully. If it doesn't, then there was a problem M    server/besctl.in

	Changed the error message where a data handler is not found to say data handler instead of request handler. M    dispatch/BESRequestHandlerList.cc

	Removed yet another message to stdout. M    ppt/PPTServer.cc

	Added a ConstraintEvaluator to the DataHandlerInterface so that data handlers could add constraint functions of the different types to use when sending the response object. M    dispatch/BESFilterTransmitter.cc M    dispatch/BESBasicTransmitter.cc M    dispatch/BESDataHandlerInterface.h

	Removed output to stdout when starting and stopping the besd and the bes applications. Modified the besctl to output more information. M    dispatch/BESBaseApp.cc M    ppt/UnixSocket.cc M    ppt/SocketListener.cc M    ppt/TcpSocket.cc M    server/besctl.in M    server/daemon.cc M    server/ServerApp.cc

2006-08-19  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Changed the signature of the Module initialize and terminate routines to take the name of the module as specified in the bes configuration file. This way, request handlers and whatever else can use the name as specified in the bes configuration file instead of a hard-coded name. Changed adding the catalog to first look to see if a catalog with the given name has already been added. if it has, then the new one is not added and false is returned. Also added rem_catalog and find_catalog methods to BESCatalogList. M    dispatch/BESCatalogList.cc M    dispatch/BESModule.h M    dispatch/BESCatalog.h M    dispatch/BESModuleApp.cc M    dispatch/BESCatalogList.h M    dispatch/BESModule.cc M    dispatch/BESAbstractModule.h M    dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.cc M    server/test/TestModule.cc M    server/test/TestModule.h M    command/DAPCommandModule.cc M    command/DAPCommandModule.h

	Default uncompression script for uncompressing compressed data files using gzip and bzip2

	Added ability to uncompress compressed data files by using the access method on the BESContainer class, rather than simply calling get_real_name, which is what was being called. Call get_real_name to simply get the real name of the file, but use access when ready to access the file for reading. Added three parameters to the configuraiton file. BES.CacheDir specifies where the uncompressed files will be stored, default /tmp. BES.Compressed.Extensions is a regular expression of the different compressed file types. BES.Compressed.Script is the shell command to use to uncompress the files, not just gzip or bzip2, but a script that can determine what to use to uncompress the files, determine the name of the cached file that will be created, uncompress the data file, and echo to stdout what the cached file name is. M    dispatch/BESBasicTransmitter.cc M    dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in M    dispatch/Makefile.am M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.h M    dispatch/BESContainer.h M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.cc M    dispatch/BESContainer.cc

2006-08-17  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Changed in the bes configuration file parameters that start with OPeNDAP to BES. Catalog entries that started with Catalog were changed to start with BES. M    dispatch/BESLog.cc M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageList.cc M    dispatch/BESMemoryGlobalArea.cc M    dispatch/BESModuleApp.cc M    dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageFile.cc M    dispatch/BESInfoList.cc M    dispatch/BESHelpResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESContainerStorageCatalog.cc M    dispatch/BESExceptionManager.cc M    dispatch/BESCatalogDirectory.cc M    ppt/Makefile.am M    server/BESServerHandler.cc M    server/ServerApp.cc

2006-08-15  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Checking for kerberos and bumped version to 3.2.0 because of Exception changes, changes to creating BESInfo objects and the transfer of those objects. M    configure.ac

2006-08-14  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Apache module using new versions of Exception classes. Also added support for using authentication tokens with the username instead of just the username. M    apache/BESApacheInterface.cc M    apache/BESApacheWrapper.cc M    apache/BESApacheWrapper.h M    apache/mod_opendap.cc M    apache/BESApacheRequests.cc

	The macro wrapper in PPTClient.h had a typo in the #define. Removed the CVS Log tag from the bottom of the file as well. M    PPTClient.h

	Instead of user information, clients might send token information, that can be used for authentication. M    BESDataRequestInterface.h M    BESDataNames.h

2006-08-11  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Added a --with-kerberos option to the bes configuration, which defaults to /usr/kerberos/include, in the openssl.m4 file. M    conf/openssl.m4

	Modified openssl.m4 to check for the kerberos includes whether or not -with-openssl is passed or not. Before, this was only being looked for if that flag was NOT being passed in to the configure script. Modified it so it does look no matter what. M    conf/openssl.m4

2006-08-07  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Ticket #467. The CatalogDirectory includes first what is in the Include parameter in the bes configuration file and then applies the Exclude Paramter. This is different from the original behavior that first applied the Exclude parameter and then the Include parameter. The TypeMatch parameter is only used when creating containers where a regular expression is matched to determine the type of data. Updated the bes.conf.in file to describe better the Include and Exclude parameters. M    BESCatalogDirectory.cc M    bes/bes.conf.in

	Message letting the client know that the informational file was not found was missing a space before the "not found" part. M    BESInfo.cc

2006-08-03  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	stopbes renamed to besctl, which was renamed to besctl.in. Changed Makefile.am to create run directory under $prefix. This is where the bes.pid file is created when besd is run and where besctl looks for the bes.pid file to stop, restart, and check status. D    server/stopbes M    server/Makefile.am D    server/besctl

2006-08-02  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	besctl command to start, stop, restart, check status, and display the current config file. Created a .in file in the server directory with the besctl being created during the configure. besctl is installed in the sbin directory. M    configure.ac A    server/besctl.in M    server/Makefile.am

	BES control script, start, stop, restart, and status commands A    besctl

	Added default cache directory setting for HDF4 data handler. M    bes.conf.in

2006-07-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated properties on NEWS

	Updates to ChangeLog, configure.ac and NEWS: info about version 3.1.1. dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in: Fixed problems with names in bug #456.

2006-07-11  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Method in BESInfo set_buffered should be returning whether the info is being buffered after it sets it. Now it does. M    dispatch/BESInfo.h

2006-07-06  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	sbin_SCRIPTS was not being added to the list of files to distribute, so I had to add EXTRA_DIST to Makefile.am. M    server/Makefile.am

	stopbes script is installed into sbin along with bes and besd. stopbes is a script that can stop the bes daemon given the location of the pid file. M    server/Makefile.am

	Changed dap_cmdmodule library name to dap_cmd_module so that all loaded module libraries are named <something>_module M    command/Makefile.am

	Moved killdods to stopbes, removing references to dods A    server/stopbes D    server/killdods

	Updated killdods to stop the bes daemon properly. Updated error message in daemon.cc to inform users of already running daemon. M    server/killdods M    server/daemon.cc

2006-07-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	bes.conf: Fixed the comments/examples for TypeMatch and related parameters so that they use semicolons instead of commas. Also fixed the example text so that the hdf4 handler will work as described. M    dispatch/bes/bes.conf.in

2006-06-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	bes.conf.in: Added "OPeNDAP.Help.XML=@prefix@/etc/bes/dispatch_help.txt"

	configure.ac: Teh bes.conf file in dispatch/bes) is now generated from bes.conf.in.

	Added bes.conf.in and remove bes.conf. Now configure make the bes.conf, substituting for @prefix@.

	Updated INSTALL and README for the 3.1.0 source release.

2006-06-30  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	The error message from the daemon that it could not create or write to the pid file in the run directory ... did say that. Updated the message to more clearly state the problem. M    server/daemon.cc

	If a libdap Error exception is caught, instead of throw a plain BESException, which will eventually force the server to exit, throw a BESHandlerException instead which will not force an exit. The BESHandlerException simply reports a problem in the data handler. M    dispatch/BESInterface.cc

	When an exception is caught and the response is built with the exception in BESExceptionManager, the response is still for the request, even though an exception was thrown. The response then needs to be named the same as if the request was successful and no exception was thrown. It was being named BESException, but that's not thre name of the response. The response needs to be named, for example, showInfo or setContainer. M    dispatch/BESVersionResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESDelContainerResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESKeysResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESDDXResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESDataResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESCatalogResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESProcIdResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESHelpResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESDelContainersResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESSetContainerResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESResponseNames.h M    dispatch/BESDelDefsResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESShowContainersResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESDASResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESDelDefResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESDefineResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESDDSResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESDataHandlerInterface.h M    dispatch/BESShowDefsResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESStatusResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESExceptionManager.cc

	added xml document type header to xml output in BESXMLInfo.cc

	BES was not sending data completion token when there is an exception

2006-06-29  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	When using indentation in informational responses, need to make sure that we aren't reducing the indentation too much. Shouldn't happen, but put the checks in just to make sure. M    dispatch/BESInfo.cc M    dispatch/BESXMLInfo.cc M    dispatch/BESHTMLInfo.cc M    dispatch/BESTextInfo.cc

	When exiting, the Back End Server was sending a message that it was exiting. No need to send this kind of exit. The exception type will do that for us, if unknown or a data handler exception. Data Request Handler classes need to catch error specific to their implemtation and throw BESExceptions instead, and determine what exceptions are fatal and which are just problems. M    server/BESServerHandler.cc

2006-06-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Set the executable property for config.guess, config.sub and install.

2006-06-29  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	have to add the three sysconf files to EXTRA_DIST

	Makefile updates for distcheck

	Moving bes.conf to dispatch directory

	moved and renamed help files

	moved and renamed help files

2006-06-28  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	exception management now done in BESExceptionManager rather than BESInterface. BESInfo classes modified and streamlined. Info classes created through BESInfoList now instead with configuration in bes configuration file. Exceptions cleaned up.

2006-06-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated some of the Makefile.am files and tries to remove the 0x40 characters in some of the source files (which gcc complains about). M    dispatch/Makefile.am M    dispatch/BESDelContainersResponseHandler.cc M    dispatch/BESDefineResponseHandler.cc M    command/Makefile.am

	Added ChangeLog and NEWS files.
	A    ChangeLog
	A    NEWS

2006-06-19  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	test code and expected output updated with name changes

2006-06-16  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

2006-05-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	UnixSocket.cc: I removed so debug code, added some comments and cleaned up my fix for the socket bind bug that showed up on OS/X. I also changed the call to strcpy to strncpy since the size of the string is 104 char.

	UnixSocket.cc: Fix for the fix; Looks like the original way of passing the size of the sockaddr structure was right but missing a '+1.'

	UnixSocket.cc: Fixed the calls to bind. Each call passed a bad value for the size of the sockaddr struct. On OS/X this caused the name of the socket to be truncated and the code could not remove the old socket using unlink. This problem did not show up on Linux.

2006-05-26  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	Added use of the newly hacked DODSFilter class to the send_data() method. This is an example; there's a much more general way to incorporate the changed class but I have not tested even this little modification. Advantages to using DODSFilter are that it knows how to process conditional requests, compressed responses and cached stuff.

	Using App class for Handler

	Using App class for Handler

	in interactive mode all commands, client and server, must end with a semicolon. Let the user know.

	adding back

	need to replace somehow

	no need to check for the c compiler, only the C++ compiler

	Using new PPT library using sockets and encapsulating the PPT calls. This way we can switch in and out different communication protocols without changing this code.

	No longer needing this code

	Completely re-worked PPT to keep it more moduler, more black box, so that external code need not know about how to communicate using PPT, but the underlying client and server connection code knows how to initiate a connection, terminate a connection, transmit data with a terminate string, etc...

	Using the new PPT library, much more moduler

	OPeNDAP Apache module that uses command line interface to parse a URL request.

	Implemented command line command syntax in separate library, not part of dispatch, so now can implement SOAP interface, or some other interface to OPeNDAP-g

	Removed parse methods from response handler making the command syntax a separate library in a separate directory, the command directory. Removed GetResponseHandler and ShowResponseHandler because these weren't really response handlers but just classes to parse the commands, which have been moved to OPeNDAPGetCommand and OPeNDAPShowCommand in the command directory. Removed most variables from DODSDataHandlerInterface and replaced them with a map of string-string pairs representing those variables. Each request will have a different set of variables needed to execute that request. Moved DODSApache and DODSWrapper to an apache directory. Also moved DODSParser to the command directory and called it OPeNDAPCmdParser. Also changed the aggregation server to be like the return mechanism. The aggregation command was changed to say "aggregate using <name> by <command>". So now the aggregation method looks up the aggregation handler with the given name and executes the command against the handler.

	changed to have keys file passed in to the constructor instead of specifying dods ini file

	If Verbose key in initialization file was set to no then DODSMemoryGlobalArea suspended logging to TheDODSLog but never turned it back on, so non-verbose logging also didn't get logged. Called the resume method on TheDODSLog to turn logging back on. Might want to think about using the general verbose flag for this.

2005-07-06  Patrick West  <pwest@opendap.org>

	moved dods.ini to opendap.ini. Default prefix is $OPENDAP_ROOT, not installing headers.

	default prefix is $OPENDAP_ROOT and header install directory is include/opendap-g.

	default prefix is OPENDAP_ROOT, header install directory is include/opendap-g.

	Made default prefix $OPENDAP_ROOT and header install directory include/opendap-g.

	New documentation. Now have wrapper holding on to encoded url string so can ask wrapper for different keyword/value pairs in the url, such as username and request.

	Moving opendap-g server listener and daemon to top level directory

	Moving opendap-g ppt code to top level directory

	Moving opendap-g dispatch code to top level daemon directory

	Creating the daemon directory that will be the location for opendap-g code dispatch, ppt, server listener and daemon, opendap-g client library and cmdln.
