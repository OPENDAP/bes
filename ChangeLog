2006-05-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	UnixSocket.cc: I removed so debug code, added some comments and
	cleaned up my fix for the socket bind bug that showed up on OS/X.
	I also changed the call to strcpy to strncpy since the size of the
	string is 104 char.

2006-05-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	UnixSocket.cc: Fix for the fix; Looks like the original way of
	passing the size of the sockaddr structure was right but missing a
	'+1.'

2006-05-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	UnixSocket.cc: Fixed the calls to bind. Each call passed a bad
	value for the size of the sockaddr struct. On OS/X this caused the
	name of the socket to be truncated and the code could not remove
	the old socket using unlink. This problem did not show up on
	Linux.

	request, in case there are new set requests. Created definition
	stores just like container stores, default being volatile. Updated

2005-08-23  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Using App class for Handler

2005-08-22  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	in interactive mode all commands, client and server, must end with
	a semicolon. Let the user know.

2005-08-22  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	when setting output to a file in client command, open to append to
	the file, not truncate

	send output to file

2005-08-22  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	module that must be linked in if the server wants http
	transmission. Removed different PERSISTENCE_INIT macros and
	replaced with one. Added TRANSMITTER_INIT macro

2005-08-22  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	local dependencies on dispatch, ppt and command directories, not
	installed versions

	no need to check for the c compiler, only the C++ compiler

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Using new PPT library using sockets and encapsulating the PPT
	calls. This way we can switch in and out different communication
	protocols without changing this code.

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	No longer needing this code

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Completely re-worked PPT to keep it more moduler, more black box,
	so that external code need not know about how to communicate using
	PPT, but the underlying client and server connection code knows
	how to initiate a connection, terminate a connection, transmit
	data with a terminate string, etc...

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Using the new PPT library, much more moduler

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	OPeNDAP Apache module that uses command line interface to parse a
	URL request.

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Implemented command line command syntax in separate library, not
	part of dispatch, so now can implement SOAP interface, or some
	other interface to OPeNDAP-g

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Removed parse methods from response handler making the command
	syntax a separate library in a separate directory, the command
	directory. Removed GetResponseHandler and ShowResponseHandler
	because these weren't really response handlers but just classes to
	parse the commands, which have been moved to OPeNDAPGetCommand and
	OPeNDAPShowCommand in the command directory. Removed most
	variables from DODSDataHandlerInterface and replaced them with a
	map of string-string pairs representing those variables. Each
	request will have a different set of variables needed to execute
	that request. Moved DODSApache and DODSWrapper to an apache
	directory. Also moved DODSParser to the command directory and
	called it OPeNDAPCmdParser. Also changed the aggregation server to
	be like the return mechanism. The aggregation command was changed
	to say "aggregate using <name> by <command>". So now the
	aggregation method looks up the aggregation handler with the given
	name and executes the command against the handler.

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	changed to have keys file passed in to the constructor instead of
	specifying dods ini file

2005-08-18  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

2005-08-08  root

	Auto reset of Subversion properties

2005-08-01  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	changed aggregation command to be aggregate using <agg_handler> by
	<agg_command>, agg_command wrapped in quotes still

2005-07-13  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	If Verbose key in initialization file was set to no then
	DODSMemoryGlobalArea suspended logging to TheDODSLog but never
	turned it back on, so non-verbose logging also didn't get logged.
	Called the resume method on TheDODSLog to turn logging back on.
	Might want to think about using the general verbose flag for this.

2005-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	moved dods.ini to opendap.ini. Default prefix is $OPENDAP_ROOT, not
	installing headers.

2005-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	default prefix is $OPENDAP_ROOT and header install directory is
	include/opendap-g.

	include/opendap-g.

2005-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	New documentation. Now have wrapper holding on to encoded url
	string so can ask wrapper for different keyword/value pairs in the
	url, such as username and request.

2005-07-05  Rob Morris <Robert.O.Morris@jpl.nasa.gov>

	Set eol-style to native on all text file in the trunk
