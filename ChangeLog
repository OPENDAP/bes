	* Merged with release-3-4-3FCS

2004-02-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-4-2FCS

2004-01-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* I moved the release-3-4 tag to a branch (because at least some
	of the files had this as a regular tag) and then tagged everything
	here as release-3-4FCS. This was to fix the problem with
	release-3-4 not being a branch! I have no idea what affect this
	will have on the merging process.

2003-05-06  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added tests.conf file which can be used by the configure script
	so that builders don't have to use a long, unwieldy, command line.

2003-01-30    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* I merged with the code marked release-3-2-4, which was the last
	tag I could find. Weird, given the entry here made on 2002-05-01.
	The code fails eight tests, all have something to do with
	Sequences. the code from the 3.2 branch exhibits the same behavior
	when linked with the trunk DAP, but works fine with the 3.2 dap.
	However, the changes between the 3.2 and trunk dap seem very
	minor... 

2002-06-03    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* HDFSequence.cc: Removed call to Sequence::set_level().

2002-05-01    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-6.

2002-04-11    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed casts littered throughout the code. Files: HDFArray.cc,
	HDFFloat32.cc, HDFFloat32.h, HDFGrid.cc, HDFInt16.cc, HDFInt16.h,
	HDFSequence.cc, HDFStructure.cc, HDFUInt16.cc, HDFUInt16.h,
	dodsutil.h, funcs.cc, hdfdesc.cc.

	* dodsutil.cc: Not used; removed. 

	* hc2dap.cc: Removed HDFTypeName functions.

	* funcs.cc: Replaced BaseType::type_name() with BaseType::type()
	* dodsutil.cc: Ibid.

	* Massive changes to the code (checked in on 4/9/2002 and
	4/10/2002). Changed HDFArray, HDFStructure, HDFSequence and
	HDFGrid so that all of the DODS numeric types are used when
	spitting out variables from HDF files. Also changes hc2dap.cc so
	that calls to ExportDataForDODS are no longer made.

2002-01-29  Dan Holloway <d.holloway@gso.uri.edu>

	* Added new elements in the hdf_vgroup structure
	to maintain the string-representation of the variable
	associated with each vgroup tag/ref in the hdf datafile.
	This is required to support modifications to the Ancillary
	DDS to limit the number of variables accessible (Modis M3)
	to a more manageable number.   Previously, the Ancillary
	DDS was assumed to be a simple cache of the actual DDS
	from the hdf datafile, no modifications were possible.  The
	new behavior allows removing variables only, you cannot
	move vgroup variables among containers, though that is
	certainly possible just not supported.

	* Fixes in hdfclass/hcstream.h,hdfclass.h,vgroup.cc
	* Fixes in hc2dap.cc/LoadStructureFromVgroup
	
2001-10-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-4.

	* Minor fixes for configure.

	* Updated README and INSTALL.

2001-09-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-3. The next merge should use
	release-3-2-3 -j release-3-2.

2001-09-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Minor build fixes.

2001-08-29  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* I removed some old files in src (dattr.cc, escfilt.cc, ...) that
	were no longer used. I also updated Makefile.in's list of
	dependencies. This should fix a nagging problem (bug 246) where
	the HDF server would not build on Solaris because make there
	wanted to compile dattr.cc (which no longer builds).

2001-08-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-2. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-2 -j release-3-2.

2001-08-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a bug in the hdf-eos lex scanner (Ethan).

	* Changed to the new way DODSFilter handles version requests.

	* Modified basename() so it would remove the garbage from the
	beginning of the names of decompressed files.

	* Removed the code which escapes names. This function is now
	handled for all the servers by the dap.

2001-06-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2 head (tagged release-3-2-1). The next
	merge should use -j release-3-2-1 -j release-3-2.

	* Many bugs fixed; should build with hdf 4.1r4.

	* HDFStructure.cc: Initial error flag variable to zero in read
	method, int err=0; The read_tagref method for this datatype does
	not modify the value of err for successful reads, on Linux systems
	this variable was initially non-zero. (From Dan)

	* Fixed a error in the --with-test-url switch. The identifier
	test-url was misspelled as `testurl'. Changed the default test url
	to point to `test' on the localhost.

	* Moved the CVS Log entries to the end of each file.
	Added code to catch Error objects thrown by the dap library.
	Changed the read() method's definition to match the dap library.

	* Changed to the new way DODSFilter handles version requests.

	* Removed nph-hdf in favor of nph-dods.

	* Removed TK_LIBS references, not used and references to that in
	the makefile that (that were unresolved during configure) were
	causing problems. I see no reason for references to TK_LIBS on the
	server side.

	* added note about perl modules, rewrote much text, reformatted.
	(From Tom).

2000-03-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merge: cvs update -j release-3-1-3 -j release-3-1, the next
	merge should use -j release-3-1-4 -j release-3-1

2000-03-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed the error message sent when HDF-EOS attributes are hosed.
	Now the message is embedded in the DAS object. That way the client
	gets most of the attributes back and an error message without DODS
	devising some scheme for returning both Error and DAS objects.

	* The HDF-EOS attribute scanner now ignores semicolons. Apparently
	some HDF-EOS files use semicolons to end each line in the HDF-EOS
	attribute section; this was confusing clients since the semicolons
	wound up in the output.

	* dodsutil.cc: Removed duplicates of the functions in the dap file
	escaping.cc. These were old and not getting fixed up; I'd rather
	just work on one copy of the escaping functions!

	* HDFArray.cc, etc.: Switched to the id2dods, etc. escaping
	function in the dap. This should banish the last of the string
	indexing bugs.

	* Added eosdas-test program. This can be used to test the HDF-EOS
	attribute parser.

2000-03-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merge: cvs update -j release-3-1-2 -j release-3-1, the next
	merge should use -j release-3-1-3 -j release-3-1
	
2000-03-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a bug where bad index variables were used with the
	string::find() functions. Using int, uint32, ..., variables to
	hold the indices breaks on some 64bit machines. The fixed code
	runs OK on Sol 7 (64bit) but the problem did not show up there.
	The problems shows up on alphas. I'm committing these changes and
	they'll be tested on the alpha.

	* configure now uses the new DODS_PROG_PERL test and nph-hdf.in
	uses that value for Perl. This eliminates the old exec perl hack
	which broke on Linux.

	* Fixes for the binary-tar target.

1999-11-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merge: cvs update -j release-3-1, the next merge should use -j
	release-3-1-2 -j release-3-1
	
1999-11-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixes to simplify building.

1999-05-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merge with alpha-3-0-0

1999-05-25  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Security fixes added to nph-hdf.in.

1999-05-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added test-coverage target to Makefile.in

1999-03-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added stubs for the new datatypes.

1999-01-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* The server now registers the file name properly. This ensures
	that the new projection functions can call the read() member
	function and not fail.

1998-11-11  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added Jake Hambey's tests.

1998-09-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Many changes includig support for vdata.

Tue Dec 30 15:59:46 1997  James Gallagher  <jimg@localhost>

	* Changed the filter programs so that they use the new DODSFilter
	class. This corrects problems with those program and the
	DODS_Dispatch perl class.
