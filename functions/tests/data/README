The *.bescmd files in this directory are used to make *.dods, .das,
etc., files that are then used by the dapreader handler for various
tests so that we can test things like server functions on real data
without needing the actual handlers that read the real data files.
This decouples the handers' tests from other handlers.

Use the besstandalone program with the 'build_responses.conf' file
to make the .dods, ..., 'response files' and then use those with 
dapreader to simulate reading actual HDF4, etc., files.
