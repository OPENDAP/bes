The STARE mapping function takes a set of STARE data and uses the lat/lon values to calculate STARE indeces and map them to corresponding x/y values.

The function connects to OPeNDAP servers to get the lat/lon data.
The lat and lon are stored in seperate arrays.
The arrays are then iterated through and the STARE index is calculated for each lat/lon pair
The STARE index, iterator values, latitude, and longitude are all stored in a struct
An unordered hash map is used - with the STARE index being the key and the struct being the value
An array consisting of the same values is then used to create an hdf5 file
