The STARE mapping function takes a set of STARE data and uses the lat/lon values to calculate STARE indices and map them to corresponding x/y values.

The function connects to OPeNDAP servers to get the lat/lon data.
The lat and lon are stored in separate arrays.
The arrays are then iterated through and the STARE index is calculated for each lat/lon pair
The STARE index, iterator values, latitude, and longitude are all stored in a struct
An unordered hash map is used - with the STARE index being the key and the struct being the value
An array consisting of the same values is then used to create an hdf5 file 


Example run:
./build_sidecar -o testFile.h5 -v http://test.opendap.org/opendap/STARE/MYD09.A2019003.2040.006.2019005020913.hdf 10 20
	-o testFile.h5 		Will save the data to the file testFile.h5
	<url>				Data url to get the lat/lon data from
	10 					The level of detail to use when calculating the STARE index
	20					The build level used when calculating the STARE index
