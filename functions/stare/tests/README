This directory holds tests for the count(), subset() and intersection()
STARE server functions. The tests use the MYD09 dataset at the 'base'
with s indices computed to level 27 but with the resolution set to ~level 14
(using the spacing between the lat/lon points as per build_sidecar's -r
option). The 'resolution.conf' file can be used with ./testsuite to
use the full resolution MYD09 s indices instead. Since some of the tests
use the full res Target dataset, it's possible to see the case where the
two region overlap without any of the stare indices intersecting.

Because some of the tests use the Target's s indices with res set to level 14,
some of the tests will find subsets/intersections when using the full res
MYD09 datasets stare indices.
