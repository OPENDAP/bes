bes (3.20.7-1) trusty; urgency=medium

* Hyrax can generate signed S3 requests when processing dmr++
  files whose data content live in S3 whenÂ the correct credentials
  are provided (injected) into the server.

* For configurations that require Hyrax to authenticate to access various
  remote resources, Hyrax can now utilize ~/.netrc (or a netrc file may
  be specified in site.conf) and Hyrax will use the appropriate credentials,
  if they are present.

* The get_dmrpp script for dmr++ production has been enhanced with better
  configuration options and built in QC tests for inventory along with
  a simple value test.

* The get_dmrpp script will default to using a template string for the value
  of the dmrpp:href URL when a URL is not provided with a -u switch. This
  allows the URL to be injected later.

* We fixed a problem with fill values by converting the FillValue type to
  the data type of the associated variable.

* Fileout NetCDF has a new configuration key, FONc.NoGlobalAttrs that can
  be used to suppress global attributes.

hdf5_handler

* The CF option support is enhanced.

* Added support for correctly generating dmr++ files.

* Enhanced support to handle netCDF-4 like HDF5 files and general two
  dimensional latitude and longitude files.

  See the modules/hdf5_handler/ChangeLog for details.
