#### NGAP & DMR++ Improvements
* The dmr++ production chain: get_dmrpp, build_dmrpp, check_dmrpp, merge_dmrpp, and
  reduce_mdf received the following updates:
  - Support for injecting configuration modifications to allow fine tuning of the
    dataset representation in the produced dmr++ file.
  - Support for HDF5 COMPACT layout data.
  - Optional creation and injection of missing (domain coordinate) data as needed.
  - Endian information carried in Chunks
  - Int64 support
  - Updated command line options and help page.

* Improved S3 reliability by adding retry efforts for common S3 error responses that
  indicate a retry is worth pursuing (because S3 just fails sometimes and a retry
  is suggested).

* Improved and more transparent error handling for remote access issues.

* Migrated the service implementation making parallel requests using multi-cURL to
  the c++11 std:async and std:future mechanism.

* Added caching of S3 “effective” URLs obtained from NGAP service chain.

* Implemented support for EDL token chaining.

* New implementation of ngap restified path parser that is (almost) impervious to
  the the key value content in the path.

* Implemented the SuperChunk optimization for mass acquisition of required, consecutive
  chunks.

#### BALTO
* Updated JSON-LD content of the server’s Data Request Form pages so that it is (once
  again) in keeping with the (evolving) rules enforced by the Rich Results page which
  is part of Google’s Dataset Search

#### DAP4
* AsciiTransmit supports DAP4 functions
* Group support in fileout netcdf-4

#### General
* End Of Life for CentOS-6 Support - It’s been a long road CentOS-6, but NASA has
  given us the OK to drop support for you just days before your nominal end of
  life. On to the next std::future.

* Dropped the “longest matching” Whitelist configuration key in favor of a multiple
  regular expressions configuration using the new AllowedHosts key.

* Consolidation of internal HTTP code and caching for all services. This means more
  consistent behavior and error handling everywhere the server has to reach out for
  something.

* Introduced log message types: request, error, info, verbose, and timing which all
  log to BES.LogName/. Each type is identified in the log and has a “fixed” format
  that can be reliably parsed by downstream software.

* Updated GDAL handler.

* SonarCloud and /or Snyk is now a blocking step for all Hyrax component PRs

* Our Docker images have been updated to utilize ncWMS-2.4.2 which is compatible
  with current Tomcat security measures. This means ncWMS2 is working again…

* Dynamic Configuration - This feature is currently a proof-of-concept idea and is
  disabled with a compiler macro. To become an actual feature it will need to be
  implemented in a much more thoughtful and efficient manner. Which we will be happy
  to do so if there is sufficient interest!


bes (3.20.7-1) trusty; urgency=medium

* Hyrax can generate signed S3 requests when processing dmr++
  files whose data content live in S3 when the correct credentials
  are provided (injected) into the server.

* For configurations that require Hyrax to authenticate to access various
  remote resources, Hyrax can now utilize ~/.netrc (or a netrc file may
  be specified in site.conf) and Hyrax will use the appropriate credentials,
  if they are present.

* The get_dmrpp script for dmr++ production has been enhanced with better
  configuration options and built in QC tests for inventory along with
  a simple value test.

* The get_dmrpp script will default to using a template string for the value
  of the dmrpp:href URL when a URL is not provided with a -u switch. This
  allows the URL to be injected later.

* We fixed a problem with fill values by converting the FillValue type to
  the data type of the associated variable.

* Fileout NetCDF has a new configuration key, FONc.NoGlobalAttrs that can
  be used to suppress global attributes.

hdf5_handler

* The CF option support is enhanced.

* Added support for correctly generating dmr++ files.

* Enhanced support to handle netCDF-4 like HDF5 files and general two
  dimensional latitude and longitude files.

  See the modules/hdf5_handler/ChangeLog for details.

Notable Bugs Fixed:
- Memory leak fixed and unneeded copy removed in awsv4 code
- CovJson patch.
- ncml_handler: When an NCML aggregation named a dataset that 
  the server could not read... crsh. Fixed..
- Server cache stabliszation

Features:
- Added (alpha) support support for server authentication 
  credentials:
- - Environment injection support for besstandalone and besd
- - A credentials configuration file for multiple sets, in 
    which credentials are asscoaied with URL prefixs and multiple 
    creds can be defined in a bes.conf environment.   
- Combined Logs: The server can now be configured to add the OLFS 
  request log content to the BES log.

Performance Improvements
 - No DAS construction for data response.
