bes (3.21.1) trusty; urgency=medium

## BES Updates

* Streamlined BESLog i/o operator implementations.
* Improved support for log requests for dap4 responses.
* Fixed a bug that caused in some edge cases segmentation fault for the HDF4
  handler.
* correct the byte_per_element assignment for the fixed string handling
* Initial support to handle the array of structure in chunking storage
* Improved the evaluation URLs for S3 signing

### DMR++ Improvements
* Improved support to set the correct struct size to the chunk  if that size
  can be found in the dmrpp.
* dmrpp now reads the default fill value of a compound data type.
* DmrppArray now returns int_64
* DMRpp file can now represent multi-linked-blocks in a chunk.
* Improved process to read multi-blocks chunk data and transfer of block
  offsets and lengths info to DMRppArray.
* Initial support to store structure offset and structure size so that the
  dmrpp module can retrieve structure data.
* Update gen_dmrpp_side_car by adding a new option for users to point to an 
  existing sidecar file
* New option to the gen_dmrpp_side_car python so that users can add the path
  to the HDF5 or the side car files.
* Initial support of compressed compound datatype variables.
* Now generates dmrpp files that include the CF grid variables.
* Added new EOS2 CF grid attributes for build_dmrpp_h4 to add missing grid
  data.
* Adds fake coord dimensions for NetCDF4 when missing dimension names and
  EnableCF option turned on.
* Creation time is now added to the build_dmrpp metadata.
* Now add DAP4 dimensions for the HDF4 SDS/HDF-EOS2 Grid variables. This is
  required  to use the fileout netCDF to access HDF4 data via the HDF4 handler.
* Includes an option to turn off the generation of the HDF4/HDF-EOS2 missing
  data in the dmrpp file
* Added support to handle data subset for HDF-EOS2 lat/lon.
* Added support for HDF-EOS2 latitude/longitude data retrieval by the HDF4 
  handler.
* Added a dmrpp test that generates from the CF option of the HDF5 handler that
  has the group hierarchy
* Added support to read compressed missing data from dmrpp.
* Addeed support to add HDF-EOS2 lat/lon data to the dmrpp file.
* Added HDF-EOS2 projection code.
* Added support to access the HDF4 data that uses linked blocks with and without
  compression.

bes (3.20.11-0) trusty; urgency=medium

## BES Updates
* Support for RHEL8

  functionality is working now.
# Continued general migration to C++11 coding norms.

* Improved support for more GES DISC level 3 and level 4 products
* Support for add the support of AIRS level 3 and GLDAS level products.
* Refactored project so that all of the code that depends on the gdal library
  is in a single module, modules/gdal_module.
* Retired use of auto_ptr.
*  Refactored timeout implementation and dropped the use of SIGALRM therein.
* Modified fileout_netcdf handler to allow netcdf-3 responses to be up to 4GB
  in size. This behavior can be reverted by setting FONc.NC3ClassicFormat=true
  in the BEs configuration (aka /etc/bes/site.conf file)

### DMR++ Improvements

* Various improvements for supporting FillValue in dmr++ lifecycle.
* Various improvements for supporting FillValue in dmr++ lifecycle.

  elements. This support extends to a number of DAAC "specials"
  like HDF-EOS5


bes (3.20.10-0) trusty; urgency=medium

#### NGAP & DMR++ Improvements

* Trusted cmr (#485)
  - Modifying things into shape to use http::url anstead of std::string
  - Replaced strings with http::url objects
  - Moved AllowedHosts to http
  - Fixed implmentations of http::url::is_expired()
  - Switch RemoteSource constructor to shared_ptr
  - Changed the way that http::url interprets no protocol urls/
  - Fixed concurrency issues in EffectiveUrlCache

* Corrected usage statement for get_dmrpp
* Handle the "missing data" files in the NGAP system
* Update NgapApiTest to reflect changes in CMR holdings.

* Dropped useless call to Chunk.inflate() and added a state check to protect us
  from a CONTIGUOUS variable that is marked as compressed.
* Rewrote read_contiguous() with std::async() and std::future dropping the SuperChunk idea.

* First implementation of the new restified path with two mandatory and one optional path components.

#### DAP4
* DAP4 doesn't support DAP2 Grid. The code that handles the DAP2 Grid coordinates
  will cause some DAP4 coordinate variables under different groups to be ignored.
  So this fix ensure the code NOT to call the code that handles the DAP2 Grid coordiantes
  for the DAP4 case.

#### General
* Added GitHub Actions to bes.
* Stop parser EffectiveUrl resolution activity (#532)

* Fonc refactor
  - Added support for streaming netCDF3 files that do not contain Structures.
  - Fix a small memory leak in the history attribute code at the transmitter.
  - Add history attribute is added to dap4.
  - Add NC.PromoteByteToShort=true in the configuration file. This makes it consistent with nc.conf.in.
    Also it make sures the value of signed 8-bit integer to be correctly represented in DAP2.
  - Remove unused getAttrType function from FONcArray.cc.
  - Dropping throttle from Fonc_transmiter

* Added throttle to BESUtil::file_to_stream()

* Ensure the data value correctness for the classic model.
  - When encountering a mismatch for the data type mapping mismatches,an error will be generated. (HYRAX-467)
  - For the classic model, ensure the _fillvalue datatype to be the same as the variable datatype.

* Server handler refactor (#513)
* Fixing duplicate CF history entries (#504)

* Perform comprehensive check of datatype match and implementation of ensuring _FillValue attribute
  type the same as the variable type. (HYRAX-449)

* Added new implementation of temp file transfer code for fileout_netcdf (#498)
* Added config param Http.UserAgent (#493)

* Fixed netCDF-4 and compression information is missing when A DAP2 grid maps to three netCDF variables. (#490) (HYRAX-388) 
* Adds call to the ftruncate() function in the update cache files activity, unit tests for string replace_all()

bes (3.20.8-1) trusty; urgency=medium

#### NGAP & DMR++ Improvements
* The dmr++ production chain: get_dmrpp, build_dmrpp, check_dmrpp, merge_dmrpp, and
  reduce_mdf received the following updates:
  - Support for injecting configuration modifications to allow fine tuning of the
    dataset representation in the produced dmr++ file.
  - Support for HDF5 COMPACT layout data.
  - Optional creation and injection of missing (domain coordinate) data as needed.
  - Endian information carried in Chunks
  - Int64 support
  - Updated command line options and help page.

* Improved S3 reliability by adding retry efforts for common S3 error responses that
  indicate a retry is worth pursuing (because S3 just fails sometimes and a retry
  is suggested).

* Improved and more transparent error handling for remote access issues.

* Migrated the service implementation making parallel requests using multi-cURL to
  the c++11 std:async and std:future mechanism.

* Added caching of S3 “effective” URLs obtained from NGAP service chain.

* Implemented support for EDL token chaining.

* New implementation of ngap restified path parser that is (almost) impervious to
  the the key value content in the path.

* Implemented the SuperChunk optimization for mass acquisition of required, consecutive
  chunks.

#### BALTO
* Updated JSON-LD content of the server’s Data Request Form pages so that it is (once
  again) in keeping with the (evolving) rules enforced by the Rich Results page which
  is part of Google’s Dataset Search

#### DAP4
* AsciiTransmit supports DAP4 functions
* Group support in fileout netcdf-4

#### General
* End Of Life for CentOS-6 Support - It’s been a long road CentOS-6, but NASA has
  given us the OK to drop support for you just days before your nominal end of
  life. On to the next std::future.

* Dropped the “longest matching” Whitelist configuration key in favor of a multiple
  regular expressions configuration using the new AllowedHosts key.

* Consolidation of internal HTTP code and caching for all services. This means more
  consistent behavior and error handling everywhere the server has to reach out for
  something.

* Introduced log message types: request, error, info, verbose, and timing which all
  log to BES.LogName/. Each type is identified in the log and has a “fixed” format
  that can be reliably parsed by downstream software.

* Updated GDAL handler.

* SonarCloud and /or Snyk is now a blocking step for all Hyrax component PRs

* Our Docker images have been updated to utilize ncWMS-2.4.2 which is compatible
  with current Tomcat security measures. This means ncWMS2 is working again…

* Dynamic Configuration - This feature is currently a proof-of-concept idea and is
  disabled with a compiler macro. To become an actual feature it will need to be
  implemented in a much more thoughtful and efficient manner. Which we will be happy
  to do so if there is sufficient interest!


bes (3.20.7-1) trusty; urgency=medium

* Hyrax can generate signed S3 requests when processing dmr++
  files whose data content live in S3 when the correct credentials
  are provided (injected) into the server.

* For configurations that require Hyrax to authenticate to access various
  remote resources, Hyrax can now utilize ~/.netrc (or a netrc file may
  be specified in site.conf) and Hyrax will use the appropriate credentials,
  if they are present.

* The get_dmrpp script for dmr++ production has been enhanced with better
  configuration options and built in QC tests for inventory along with
  a simple value test.

* The get_dmrpp script will default to using a template string for the value
  of the dmrpp:href URL when a URL is not provided with a -u switch. This
  allows the URL to be injected later.

* We fixed a problem with fill values by converting the FillValue type to
  the data type of the associated variable.

* Fileout NetCDF has a new configuration key, FONc.NoGlobalAttrs that can
  be used to suppress global attributes.

hdf5_handler

* The CF option support is enhanced.

* Added support for correctly generating dmr++ files.

* Enhanced support to handle netCDF-4 like HDF5 files and general two
  dimensional latitude and longitude files.

  See the modules/hdf5_handler/ChangeLog for details.
