Outstanding bugs found from HDF server testing:

dncdump hangs when reading a DODS Sequence:
  - This happens due to a bug in the netCDF client library.  The bug
    sends the client into an infinite loop!  [Reported to Reza in
    7/96]. 
  - Reproduce by:
      dncdump http://dods.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/hdf/data/nscat/20.hdf

dncdump crashes when reading an HDF file with no attributes (empty
DAS): 
  - This happens due to a bug in the netCDF client library or DODS
    core.  The bug is that the code calling Dattr.cc:get_das_table()
    doesn't check to see if it gets a null Pix back.  It then passes
    the null Pix to various DODS core routines which then core dump.
    [Reported to Reza, James 8/28/96].
  - Reproduce by:
      dncdump http://dods.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/hdf/data/test/vdata.hdf

Constraint expressions involving Structures inside Sequences do not work:
  - If one tries to access a field inside a structure which is inside
    a Sequence (i.e., any Vdata field element mapped into DAP), the
    server fails with an error like:
       Parse error: No such field in dataset: Temperature.Temperature__0
  - The problem seems to be happening in the DODS core software, in
    DDS::parse_constraint().  [Asked James to investigate 8/29/96].
