 *
 * An implementation of the abstract interface BESDefinitionStorage
 * provides storage for a definition, or view, of a set of data including
 * possibly constraints on each of those containers and possibly aggregation
 * of those containers.
 *
 * An instance of a derived implementation has a name associated with it, in
 * case that there are multiple ways in which the information can be stored.
 * For example, the main persistent storage for containers could be a mysql
 * database, but a user could store temporary information in different files.
 * If the user wishes to remove one of these persistence stores they would
 * request that a named BESDefinitionStorage object be removed from the
 * list.
