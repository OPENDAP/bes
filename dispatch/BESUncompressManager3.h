/** @brief List of all registered decompression methods
 *
 * The BESUncompressManager3 allows the developer to add or remove named
 * decompression methods from the list for this server. By default a gz and
 * bz2 and Z function is provided.
 *
 * What is actually added to the list are static decompression functions.
 * Each of these functions is responsible for decompressing a specific type
 * of compressed file. The manager knows which type to decompress by the
 * file extension.
