Current commands available with OPeNDAP:

    show help;
	* shows this help
    show containers;
	* shows all containers currently defined
    show definitions;
	* shows all definitions currently defined
    show version;
	* shows the version of OPeNDAP and each data type served by this server
    show process;
	* shows the process number of this application
    show status;
	* shows the status of the server
    show keys;
	* shows all keys defined in the dods initialization file

    set container values <symbolic_name>,<real_name>,<container_type>;

	* defines a symbolic name representing a data container, usually a file,
	  to be used by definitions, described below
	* <real_name> is the full path to a data file
	* <container_type> is the type of data that is in the file. For
	  netcdf files it is nc, for cedar it is cedar, etc...

    define <def_name> as <container_list> [where <container_x>.constraint="<constraint>",<container_x>.attributes="<attribute_list>"] [aggregate by "<aggregation_command"];

	* creates a definition using one or more containers, constraints for
	  each of the containers, attributes to be retrieved from each
	  container, and an aggregation. Constraints, attributes, and
	  aggregation are all optional.
	* <container_list> is a comma separated list of container names.
	* The constraints, attributes and aggregation command must be enclosed in quotes

    get das|dds|dods|ddx for <definition_name> [return as <return_name>];

	* dds: request the data descriptor structure
	* das: request the data attributes
	* dods: request for the data stream, this output is an octec binary 
	  stream which requires the analysis by the client dods library

    delete container <container_name>;
	* deletes the specified container
    delete definition <definition_name>;
	* deletes the specified definition
    delete definitions;
	* deletes all of the currently defined definitions
    there is no command "delete containers;"
