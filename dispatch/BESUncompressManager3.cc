 *
 *  This code tests that the file named by 'src' really should be uncompressed,
 *  returning false if it clearly should not (i.e., it does not end in an
 *  extension like '.gz') or cannot. If the file is uncompressed, this
 *  code takes care of doing all the stuff that needs to happen as far as
 *  caching the uncompressed data, ensuring that the file holding those
 *  data is locked for read-only access.
 *
 *  When new data are added to the cache, this code checks the size and, if
 *  the cache is too large, uses a LRU algorithm to remove files to make
 *  room for the new file.
 *
 *  @note As implemented, the purge() code removes files so that the
 *  resulting size of the cache will be about 80% of the maximum size of
 *  the cache as set in the bes.conf file.
 *
 * @note If there is a problem uncompressing the file, the uncompress code is
 * responsible for closing the source file, the target file, AND
 * REMOVING THE TARGET FILE. If the target file is left in place after
 * an error, then the cache might use that file in the future for a
 * request.
 *
 * @param src file to be uncompressed
 * @param cache_file Name of file to uncompress into
 * @param cache BESCache object to uncompress the src file in
 * @return true if the file's contents are in the cache and at the pathname
 * cfile
 * @throws BESInternalError if there is a problem uncompressing
 * the file
