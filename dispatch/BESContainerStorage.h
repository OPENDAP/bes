/** @brief provides persistent storage for data storage information
 * represented by a container.
 *
 * An implementation of the abstract interface BESContainerStorage
 * provides storage for information about accessing data of different data
 * types. The information is represented by a symbolic name. A user can
 * request a symbolic name that represents a certain container.
 *
 * For example, a symbolic name 'nc1' could represent the netcdf file
 * /usr/apache/htdocs/netcdf/datfile01.cdf.
 *
 * An instance of a derived implementation has a name associated with it, in
 * case that there are multiple ways in which the information can be stored.
 * For example, the main persistent storage for containers could be a mysql
 * database, but a user could store temporary information in different files.
 * If the user wishes to remove one of these persistence stores they would
 * request that a named BESContainerStorage object be removed from the
 * list.
 * 
 * @see BESContainer
 * @see BESContainerStorageList
