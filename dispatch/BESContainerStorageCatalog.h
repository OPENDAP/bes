/** @brief implementation of BESContainerStorage that represents a data
 * within a catalog repository
 *
 * When a container is added to this container storage, the file extension
 * is used to determine the type of data using a set of regular expressions.
 * The regular expressions are retrieved from the BES configuration
 * file using TheBESKeys. It also gets the catalog's root directory for
 * where the files exist. This way, the user need not know the root directory
 * or the type of data represented by the container.
 *
 * Catalog._name_.RootDirectory is the key
 * representing the base directory where the files are physically located.
 * The real_name of the container is determined by concatenating the file
 * name to the base directory.
 *
 * Catalog._name_.TypeMatch is the key
 * representing the regular expressions. This key is formatted as follows:
 *
 * _data type_ : _reg exp_ ; _data type_ : _reg exp_ ;
 *
 * For example: `cedar:cedar/.*\.cbf;cdf:cdf/.*\.cdf;`
 *
 * The first would match anything that might look like: cedar/datfile01.cbf
 *
 * _name_ is the name of this container storage, so you could have
 * multiple container stores using regular expressions.
 *
 * The containers are stored in a volatile list.
 *
