/** @brief Function to uncompress files with .bz2 extension
 *
 * The static function is responsible for uncompressing bz2 files. If the
 * uncompressed target file already exists then this function will overwrite
 * that file. If it doesn't already exist then it is created.
 *
 * If any errors occur during this operation then a
 * BESContainerStorageException will be thrown
 *
 * @param src the source file that is to be uncompressed
 * @param target the target uncompressed file
 * @throws BESContainerStorageException if errors in uncompressing the file
 * or if bz2 is not compiled into the BES.
