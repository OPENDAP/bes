Current core commands available with BES:

    show help;
	* shows this help
    show version;
	* shows the version of OPeNDAP and each data type served by this server
    show process;
	* shows the process id of the bes listener this client is attached
	  to. This command is available only in developer mode.
    show status;
	* shows the status of the server
    show config;
	* shows all key/value pairs defined in the bes configuration file.
	  This command is available only in developer mode.
    show containers;
	* shows all containers currently defined
    show context;
	* shows all context name/value pairs set in the BES

    set container [in <storage_name>] values <symbolic_name>,<real_name>,<container_type>;

	* defines a symbolic name representing a data container, usually a file,
	  to be used by definitions, described below
	* <storage_name> is the name of the container storage. Defaults to
	  volatile storage. Examples might include database storage, volatile
	  storage based on catalog information.
	* <real_name> is the full path to a data file
	* <container_type> is the type of data that is in the file. For
	  netcdf files it is nc, for cedar it is cedar, etc...

    set context <context_name> to <context_value>;
	* set the given context with the given value. No default context are
	  available in the BES.

    define <def_name> [in <storage_name>] as <container_list> [where <container_x>.constraint="<constraint>",<container_x>.attributes="<attribute_list>"] [aggregate by "<aggregation_command"];

	* creates a definition using one or more containers, constraints for
	  each of the containers, attributes to be retrieved from each
	  container, and an aggregation. Constraints, attributes, and
	  aggregation are all optional.
	* <container_list> is a comma separated list of container names.
	* <storage_name> is the name of the definition storage. Defaults to
	  volatile storage. Examples might include database storage.
	* The constraints, attributes and aggregation command must be enclosed in quotes

    delete container <container_name> [from <storage_name>];
	* deletes the specified container from the specified container
	  storage (defaults to volatile storage).</LI></UL>
    delete containers [from <storage_name>]
	* deletes all of the currently defined containers from the
	  specified container storage (defaults to volatile storage).
    delete definition <definition_name> [from <storage_name>];
	* deletes the specificed definition from the specified container
	  storage (defaults to volatile storage).
    delete definitions;
	* deletes all of the currently defined defintions from the
	  specified container storage (defaults to volatile storage).

    ** remember to terminate each command with a semicolon (;)
