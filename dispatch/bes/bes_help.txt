    <setContainer name="container_name" space="store_name" type="data_type">real_name</setContainer>

	* defines a symbolic name representing a data container, usually
	  a file, to be used by definitions, described below
	* the space property is the name of the container storage and is
	  optional.  Defaults to default volatile storage. Examples

	  catalog information.
	* real_name is the full qualtified location of the data container, for example the full path to a data file.
	* data_type is the type of data that is in the dataset.  For netcdf files it is nc. For some container storage the data type is optional, determined by the container storage.

    <setContext name="context_name">context_value</setContext>

	* set the given context with the given value. No default context
	  are used in the BES

    <define name="definition_name" space="store_name">
	<container name="container_name">
	    <constraint>legal_constraint</constraint>
	    <attributes>attribute_list</attributes>
	</container>
	<aggregate handler="someHandler" cmd="someCommand" />
    </define>

	* creates a definition using one or more containers, constraints
	  for each of the containers, attributes to be retrieved from
	  each container, and an aggregation. Constraints, attributes,
	  and aggregation are all optional.
	* There can be more than one container element
	* space is the name of the definition storage.  Defaults to
	  volatile storage. Examples might include database storage.

    <deleteContainer name="container_name" space="store_name" />

	* deletes the specified container from the specified container
	  storage (defaults to volatile storage).

    <deleteContainers space="store_name" />

	* deletes all of the currently defined containers from the
	  specified container storage (defaults to volatile storage).

    <deleteDefinition name="definition_name" space="store_name" />

	* deletes the specified definition from the specified container
	  storage (defaults to volatile storage).

    <deleteDefinitions space="store_name" />
