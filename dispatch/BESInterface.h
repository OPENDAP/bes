/** @brief Entry point into BES, building responses to given requests.

 BESInterface is an abstract class providing the entry point into the
 retrieval of information using the BES framework. There are eight
 steps to retrieving a response to a given request:

 <OL>
 <LI>initialize the BES environment</LI>
 <LI>validate the incoming information to make sure that all information
 is available to perform the query</LI>
 <LI>build the request plan to retrieve the information. A response can
 be generated for multiple files using multiple server types (cedar, cdf,
 netcdf, etc...)</LI>
 <LI>execute the request plan and build the response object</LI>
 <LI>transmit the response object</LI>
 <LI>log the status of the request</LI>
 <LI>send out report information that can be reported on by any number of
 reporters registered with the system.</LI>
 <LI>end the request</LI>
 </OL>

 The way in which the response is generated is as follows.
 A BESResponseHandler is found that knows how to build the requested
 response object. The built-in response handlers are for the
 response objects das, dds, ddx, data, help, version. These response
 handlers are added to a response handler list during initialization.
 Additional response handlers can be added to this list. For example,
 in Cedar, response handlers are registered to build flat, tab, info,
 and stream responses.

 To build the response objects a user can make many requests. For
 example, a das object can be built using as many different files as is
 requested, say for file1,file2,file3,file4. And each of these files
 could be of a different data type. For example, file1 and file3 could
 be cedar files, file2 could be cdf file and file4 could be a netcdf
 file.

 The structure that holds all of the requested information is the
 BESDataHandlerInterface. It holds on to a list of containers, each of
 which has the data type (cedar, cdf, nph, etc...) and the file to be
 read. The BESDataHandlerInterface is built in the build request method.

 The response handlers know how to build the specified response object,
 such as DAS, DDS, help, status, version, etc...

 For each container in the BESDataHandlerInterface find the
 request handler (BESRequestHandler) for the containers data type. Each
 request handler registers functions that know how to fill in a certain
 type of response (DAS, DDS, etc...). Find that function and invoke it. So,
 for example, there is a CedarRequestHandler class that registers functions
 that knows how to fill in the different response objects from cedar files.

 Once the response object is filled it is transmitted using a specified
 BESTransmitter.

 The status is then logged (default is to not log any status. It is up
 to derived classes of BESInterface to implement the log_status method.)

 The request and status are then reported. The default action is to
 pass off the reporting to BESReporterList::TheList(), which has a list of
 registered reporters and passes off the information to each of those
 reporters. For example, if the Cedar project wants to report on any
 cedar access then it can register a reporter with
 BESReporterList::TheList().
