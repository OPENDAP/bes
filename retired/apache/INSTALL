BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

  To build the BES apache module software, follow these steps:

  0. Please skim BUILD REQUIREMENTS and NOTES sections of this file before
     reporting problems. Also, this software _requires_ other software
     components be built and installed and that its configuration file be
     edited. Make sure you read over the CONFIGURATION AND TESTING section!
     Thanks.

  1. Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have
     to type `sh configure'. Options to configure must include both of the
     following:

     --with-apache=<apache_install_dir> (/usr/local/apache)
     --with-apache-src=<apache_src_dir> (/home/pwest/apache_1.3.41)

     The prefix option to configure is ignored, nothing is installed in the
     default prefix location.

  2. Type `make' to build the software, `make check' to run the tests. You
     must have DejaGNU to run `make check.' If you have cppunit installed
     then additional tests will be run. We recommend that you install
     cppunit if you have not already.

  3. Type `make install' to install the BES software. The package installs
     in the apache source directory under:

     <apache_src_dir>/src/modules/opendap

Building from Our SVN Repository

  If you are building from a SVN checkout, run 'autoreconf --verbose' before
  './configure; make'. If you try to run autoconf, et c., by hand and wind up
  with build files that don't work, use 'autoreconf --force --verbose' and
  then './configure; make'.

AFTER INSTALLING

  o See the CONFIGURATION section once you have finished building the BES.

BUILD REQUIREMENTS

  o To build this software will require apache server version 1.3.x. The
    module api for apache 2.x is not supported for the OPeNDAP BES apache
    module.

  o To build from a fresh SVN checkout, you'll need automake 1.9.2, autoconf
    2.59 (2.57 will probably work and that's what's listed in the configure.ac
    file) and libtool 1.5.6. Earlier versions may work, but may cause
    problems, particularly with the 'distcheck' target for make. Given those
    requirements, use 'autoreconf --force --verbose' and then build as
    described above.

    If you have an Intel Mac and you are experiencing configuration issues
    then you might need to download the latest and greatest autoconf,
    automake, and libtool using the DarwinPorts tool. We've tried using
    other download tools, like fink, and building from source these
    packages, but only DarwinPorts seems to resolve the issues. We continue
    to watch this issue and hope to get it resolved soon.

  o The module uses the BES dispatch and command libraries. It is required
    to have BES 3.6.1 or greater installed in order to build the BES apache
    module.

  o You should have gcc/g++ 3.3.x or greater. You'll also need to get the
    stdc++ library that matches the compiler (whatever version). NB: gcc
    2.8.x and earlier *won't* build the software. We're working on modifying
    the software so that it will build with a variety of compilers. As of
    01/22/03 we have built the code using Microsoft's Visual C++ 6.0 and GNU
    gcc/++ 3.2.1, 3.3, 3.4 and 4.0

NOTES

  o If you are building on a new platform (one for which we don't supply
    binaries), please run the tests and tell us about any failures. To do a
    really complete job of this you'll need to get the GNU test system called
    DejaGNU and the CppUnit unit testing package. It is very simple to
    install these and we're very willing to help, so don't be shy!

  o DEBUGGING AIDS

    - It is recommended to test the modules loaded with the BES apache
      module (cedar_handler, netcdf_handler, etc...) separate from the
      apache installation to ensure that the modules are working.

    - Check the BES log file, the location is specified in the BES
      configuration file. There might be some useful information in that
      file.

CONFIGURATION AND TESTING

  o CONFIGURATION

    - To build apache with the opendap module you need to add the following
      when configuring apache:

      --activate-module=src/modules/opendap/libopendap.a

    - The configuration file for BES is located in the apache installation
      directory under conf, and is called opendap.ini. The user running
      apache must have the environment variable BES_CONF to the location of
      this configuration file in order for it to be found.

  o TESTING

    - Once you have built the software you can run 'make check' to make sure
      that the software is working properly.

    - Once the software is installed and the apache server is installed with
      the opendap module test it by using the URL:

      http://your_domain.com/opendap?request=show+version;
