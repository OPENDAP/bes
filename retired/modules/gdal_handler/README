Updated for version 1.1.0 on 1 June 2017

I modified this handler so that it builds a DDS object that includes
global attributes and attributes for each variable. This means that 
it does not use the DDS::transfer_attributes() hack. The changes to 
do this were fairly small. I modified the code that builds the DAS so
that it includes two new functions, one to build global attributes and
one to build a given variable's attributes. These functions are used
by both the build-a-DAS and build-a-DDS functions and the DAS only code
is mostly only these functions.

The one thing that the handler not longer does is merge in ancillary 
attributes when building the DDS. I'm not sure how to support that 
without going back to the older scheme, mixing the current code and
code that loads the ancillary attrs and uses transfer_attributes() 
or new code that reads the attrs and adds them directly.
