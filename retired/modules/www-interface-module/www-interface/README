Updated for version 3.5.1 of the dap server

The www_int (WWW Interface) program is a simple HTML form interface for the
OPeNDAP server.

History: The original version of www_int was written in Perl by George
Milkowski. Qi Zhang worked out certain problems with complex datasets. The
current C++ version was implemented by James Gallagher. Both www_int and the
`directory hack' were integrated into the basic OPeNDAP servers in the Spring
of 1999.
