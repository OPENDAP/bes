README for HDF test file generators
Jake Hamby (jake.hamby@jpl.nasa.gov)
------------------------------------

This directory contains a series of simple programs to generate the HDF files
used by the included test suite.  Unlike the rest of DODS, the Makefile doesn't
use autoconf, but should be fairly straightforward.

To test the DODS HDF server, you must first install the CGI's into your web
server's cgi-bin directory.  You can't test the server without installing it
first.

To generate the HDF test files, run 'make' in this directory.  If HDF is
installed somewhere other than /usr/local/hdf, you'll need to edit the HDFDIR
line of the Makefile first.  To install the testfiles, change the INSTALLDIR
line if necessary, and run 'make install', or simply copy '*.hdf' to a location
inside your Web server's document root.

In order to run the HDF-EOS server tests, you will also need three test files:
GridFile.hdf, PointFile.hdf, and SwathFile.hdf.  I created these by running
all of the sample programs in the sample directory of the HDF-EOS
distribution.  Email me if you need a copy of them and don't want to compile
HDF-EOS on your system, as the test files are too large to include here.

As with the DAP core tests, you will need to have the DejaGNU test framework
installed before you can run the server test.  If you have installed the
testfiles in a different location than your DocumentRoot, or if you want to
test a machine other than localhost (a good idea if you want to test a server
but only have DejaGNU installed on your development box), edit TESTDIR in
the hdf-dods Makefile appropriately.  You'll also need to make sure geturl
is in the DODS bin directory.  If all is well, run "make check" in the hdf-dods
directory (the parent of this one).  All of the tests, except for the HDF-EOS
tests (if you don't have the sample HDF-EOS files installed) should pass.
