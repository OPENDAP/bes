 Populate the Metadata Store (MDS) with DDS, DAS, DMR and DMR++
 responses. 
 
 If -c <bes conf> is not given, the script looks for
 a suitable bes.conf file by looking for $prefix/etc/bes/bes.conf
 and then /etc/bes/bes.conf.
 
 If -R is given, the DMR++ response is not added to the MDS.
 
 Care should be taken when choosing the <pathname> since the 
 name is relative to the BES Catalog Data Root Directory. The
 underlying commands used by this script pass the pathname to 
 software that computes the hash of exactly the characters used
 here and to work, those relative pathnames must match exactly
 the ones sent to the BES by the OLFS. The mds_ledger records
 the names of al the items in the MDS.
