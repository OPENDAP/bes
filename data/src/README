1. There are several CDL files that are used to generate HDF5 files the testsuite uses. 
One can use ncgen to generate a corresponding netcdf4 file and then change the name to .h5.
The command to generate nc files are ncgen -k3 ???.cdl or ncgen -k4 ???.cdl .
k3 will generate an enhanced nc-4 file, k4 will generate a classic nc-4 file.

2. tcompound.h5 is generated from running h5dumpgentest which is under hdf5 standard release tools/h5dump directory.

3. Several python examples are also provided.
