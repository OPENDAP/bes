\section intro Introduction

This reference documentation corresponds to version 3.8.3 of the BES, a C++
daemon used with OPeNDAP's Hyrax data server as well as the Earth System Grid
and other projects.

More documentation about the BES can be found on the OPeNDAP documentation
site http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/Hyrax#For_Developers.

\section conventions Doxygen Conventions

This section lists some conventions used by the Doxygen comments
which are used to generate this Reference Guide. Follow these conventions
when adding to or modifying the reference documentation.

\subsection general General

<ul>
<li>When using the name of a parameter, use italics (the \c e
command or \c em tag).</li> 
<li>Use the \c c command or \c code tag when talking about literal text.</li>
<li>When talking about functions or methods, using <code>func()</code>
or <code>func(arg0, ..., agrN)</code> will get Doxygen to insert a link to
its documentation.</li>
<li>Typos: If you're using emacs, the command \c ispell-comments-and-strings
may help in removing typos in the comments (and strings ...)</li>
</ul>

\subsection classes Classes

Classes should be documented in the header (\c .h) file where they are
defined. 

Commands that should be used for the documentation of classes:

<dl> 
<dt>author</dt><dd>Use this to attribute authorship. Include this for
all the classes except internal ones which are not visible to users of the
library.</dd>
</dl>

\subsection methods Methods and Functions

Methods should be documented in the implementation (\c .cc) files where
they are defined. You can put the \c brief documentation in the header file,
but that may be more confusing than keeping all the method documentation in
one place.

Functions should be documented in their implementation files.

Commands that should be used for the documentation of public methods and
non-static functions:

<dl>
<dt>param</dt> <dd>Include for all parameters. Doxygen complains if an
overloaded method changes a parameter name, so scan the warnings and try to
keep the names in sync..</dd>

<dt>return</dt> <dd>Include for all methods that return something unless the
method is so simple its full description starts off with "Returns..."</dd>

<dt>brief</dt> <dd>Include for all methods. In doxy.conf I have turned off
the option that generates the \c brief entry from the first sentence of the
detailed doc and the option that includes the \c brief documentation in the
detailed documentation. So, the \c brief doc will appear only with the
summary information and not with the detailed documentation for the
method.</dd>

<dt>exception</dt> <dd>Document the exceptions using the \c exception
command.</dd>

</dl>
