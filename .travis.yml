    - master

# Use this to prepare the system to install prerequisites or

# Building on Ubuntu, we need uuid-dev, xml and curl
before_install:
  - sudo apt-get update -qq
  - sudo apt-get install -y libxml2-dev uuid-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev

# Use this to install any prerequisites or dependencies necessary to
# run your build

# Get, install bison 3; install it to the default prefix
install:
  - git clone --branch=master https://github.com/opendap/hyrax-dependencies
 
# Use this to prepare your build for testing e.g. copy database
# configurations, environment variables, etc.
#
# I set prefix and PATH even though it's not really needed.
before_script:
  - export prefix=`pwd`/../build
  - export PATH=$prefix/bin:$PATH
  - autoreconf --force --install --verbose
  - ./configure --prefix=$prefix

# All commands must exit with code 0 on success. Anything else is
# considered failure.
#
# NB: sudo make install failed for clang here, hence the use of
# --prefix (which we'll need anyway later when we build the bes) with
# configure above. This is an idiosyncrasy of Travis CI because of the
# way it installs clang.
