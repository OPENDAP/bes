/** @brief Module that allows for OPeNDAP Data objects to be returned as
 * geotiff files
 *
 * The FONgModule (File Out GDAL Module) is provided to allow for OPenDAP
 * Data objects to be returned as geotiff files. The get request to the BES
 * would be for the dods data product with the added element attribute of
 * returnAs="geotiff".
 *
 * This is accomplished by adding a BESTransmitter called "geotiff". When the
 * BES sees the returnAs property of the get command it looks for a
 * transmitter with that name. The FONgTransmitter is used to transmit
 * the DAP DataDDS object by first writing it out as a geotiff data file
 * and then transmitting it back to the caller.
 *
 * @see FONgTransmitter
