2015-12-28  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Patched error handling problems in Transmitter implmentations. In particular: 
	1) Ensured that libdap::Error objects are converted to BESDapError objects 
	when caught. and 2) Catch and rethrow BESError objects whenever they could 
	be thrown so they don't get swept up as unidentified errors in a catch(...) clause.

2015-10-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	coverity fixes

2015-10-01  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache configuration collisions with various handlers that also were utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir, BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from the other caches.

2015-09-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed tests after module branch merge

2014-12-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added module name and version info to Makefile.am
	This change was made to support the modules build where the autoconf
	symbols PACKAGE_NAME and _MODULE are defined by the bes configure
	script. This meant that the version response from the bes was useless
	since it listed every module as 'bes' and gave the bes' version
	number.

	Added jp2 testsuite to gitignore

	Added support for the BES modules build.
