Update for version 3.6 of the dap server

I have modified the software here so that a module for the BES is built 
in addition to the dap_asciival executable for use with Server3. The new 
module is called libascii_module.so and it has one entry point:
    
    void get_data_values_as_ascii(DataDDS *dds, FILE *dest)
    
Make sure the DataDDS contains data values!

Updated for version 3.5.1 of the dap server

The program asciival can function as both a client and a server filter
program. The asciival program can read data from a URL or a local filename.
The program prints to standard output an ASCII version of the data where
columns are separated by commas and rows separated by newlines.

Clients can request data from servers in ASCII form using the suffix .ascii
or .asc in a DAP URL. To see how the asciival program is used on the server
side, look at the DODS_Dispatch.pm Perl module.

The asciival program has been changed to match the DAP ASCII description in
the DAP RFC (see the OPeNDAP web site). The program can now process many more
datasets than before.
