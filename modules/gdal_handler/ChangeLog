	Added distcheck back into the CI build run by Travis.

	Edits to double check that subdir-option was the issue

	Merge pull request #59 from OPENDAP/cache_fix
	Cache fix

	Clean up residual cache code. Add a note about fcntl(2) versus flock(2)
	Both fcntl(2) and flock(2) can be used for advisory locking. The
	BESFileLockingCache uses fcntl() and that impacts testing since
	all of our testing is single-process. Not a huge deal, but if we
	want more complete testing we'll need to change how we implement
	the locks or use multi-process testing.

	Modest fixes to the test code in cacheT

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/cacheT_fix' into cache_fix

	This code now builds and passes the tests we have...
	But we might ned or want to write more/better tests for the cache.

2017-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix to BESFSDir for the opendir/readdir race condition.
	When two processes are using the same directory and one process makes
	and deletes files in the directory at the same time as the other
	process uses opendir/readdir to iterate over the files in the
	directory, it's possible for file names to show up in entries returned
	by readdir that no longer exist (i.e., stat(2) returns -1). It's better
	to ignore this than signal an error (IMHO).

	Added ScaleUtilTest back into the build

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:/opendap/bes

	Removed errant tab in Makefile.am

	Fixed an error in both scale_util.cc and its test code (ScaleUtilTest.cc)
	In scale_util.cc:get_gcp_data() the code samples the data and uses
	both integer division and 'increment by sample factor' and those
	were producing an off by one error in some cases.

	Removed ScaleUtilTest from bes/functions for now.

	Fixed BesDebug --> BESDebug and removed some generated files.

	Ugh. Still recovering from geo-functions merge mess - removed generatged files
	... From gateway bes-testsuite

	Added bes-testsuite for w10n handler

	Added the bes-testsuite dir back in for the gateway handler

2017-03-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed all the unused lines from the pvolT BES keys file

	Patched the pvolT test so that it writes temp files to ./cache
	This keeps those temp files from conflicting with the BESKeys use of
	a regex in the BES.Include line in one of it's test files. This is not
	a real fix for the problem, which will take a bit more time - and an
	understanding of the BES File and Dir classes...

	Fixed the various badness of my previous merge of geo-functions.

	OK. Added the gateway and w10n handlers back in.

2017-03-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added comment to ContainerStorageVolatile about needing BESKeys file

	pvolT now uses separate tests.
	I'm not sure this really addresses the underlying issue with the pvolT
	and keysT conflict, but is makes the test cleaner and might help debug
	the issue.

	Added options to unit-tests keysT and pvolT

2017-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Unit tests in dispatch fail when run in parallel. This is a fix.
	The setup() code in pvolT seems to conflict with the code in keysT
	when keysT starts and then pvolT starts and finishes before keysT
	finishes. I have no idea why, but the text in the pvolT's setup()
	shows up in keysT. It turns out that the setup() code is not needed,
	and removing it seems to fix the problem. Seems to...

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of
	changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and
	BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression
	cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache
	configuration collisions with various handlers that also were
	utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by
	calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir,
	BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we
	specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from
	the other caches.

	This merge did not go smoothly and I'm still not sure why. Serveral
	of the files (GDALArray.cc, gdal_dds.cc, gdal_das.cc) had large
	parts that were not merged at all. I copied them by hand from the

	M    gdal_handler.spec

2013-10-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Edits to match the new, sane, semantics for BaseType::read(). True
	now means done/eof and flase means more data to read (more
	instances for a sequence). All the tests pass.

2013-10-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the FSF address in the copyright headers

2013-09-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	svn ignore updated; minor change in GDALArray.cc (using <> for an include)

2013-09-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This handler used a bogus definition of BaseType::read() which caused various warnings with clang 5.

2013-09-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	removed -fno-defer-pop from all copies of Makefile.am since the
	new OSX compiler prints warnings about it and it seems to not make
	a difference with newer g++ versions.

	libgdal_module.so like all the other modules (it was also called
	that in the gdal.conf file that was installed by default).

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Maybe now, with the previously hidden files ignored, the SVN stuff
	will appear correctly in Eclipse

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Set svn ignore on many files in an attempt to get Eclipse to show
	modification status correctly.

	ignored files...

2012-07-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hack that might fix the dataset name problem - made at home and
	the new BES hacks this handler needs are not in SVN yet...

2012-07-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	fixed leaking resource problem: The handler depended on being able
	to keep the file open when accessing data (this was OK in the
	original version because the handler was a CGI and the file was
	closed each time the handler/program exited). I subclassed DataDDS
	so that the open GDAL handler for the dataset is closed using the
	DataDDS (really GDALDDS) destructor. I fixed a slew of memory
	leaks in the old code, and in the process, found a bug in libdap.
	This handler requires libdap >= 3.12.0

2012-07-25  brent

	Changes to the Grid constructor to allow the Grid to open and
	close the input itself. Fails in DODS case

2012-06-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Some minor changes like adding #define DODS_DEBUG and then
	commenting it out. The only substantial changes are to GDALGrid
	where I fixed the signature of read() and added my own impls of
	the copy ctor and operator=. Changing the type signature of read()
	fixed the bug that was making the data requests barf.

2012-06-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes made during some debugging work. Added instrumentation and
	hacked up some stuff in tests, data directories. It seems that
	there is a 'slicing' bug in the code when instances of GDDALGrid
	are added to the DDS object, although I do not where/how this is
	happening.

2012-06-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes to the bes.conf.in file plus some new tests (bescmd
	scripts in tests/gdal).

2012-06-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hacked bes.conf.in and Makefile.am here in tests so that they work.
