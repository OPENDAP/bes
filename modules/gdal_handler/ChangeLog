	Minor edits to ChangeLog

2016-11-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hyrax 1.13.2
2016-09-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' into response_cache

2016-08-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed unneeded call to GDALAllRegister in the code that reads data for a Grid map.

	Updated the tests so that a pattern is used for the baselines so
	that differences in the values of the spatial_ref attribute
	produced by GDAL 2.1 and 1.10 don't make false test fails. These
	differences are minor (the last for digits of a double value).

2016-06-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tests for the 'repeat accesses fail' bug fix (Hyrax-220)

	Updated the version number and associated files

	Refactor

	Update for bes 3.16.0 release
	
2015-10-01  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of
	changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and
	BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression
	cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache
	configuration collisions with various handlers that also were
	utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by
	calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir,
	BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we
	specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from
	the other caches.

2015-09-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes to Makefile.am in the autotest dirs; clean removes bes.conf

2015-09-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2015-07-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	package.m4 fixes
	Removed package.m4.in and added a Makefile target to build package.m4

2015-05-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added to gitignore

2015-04-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/gdal_handler

	Modified Makefile.am to support bes distcheck

2015-04-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Version 1.0.0
2015-03-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Accommodate autoconf 2.63
	Changed the AT_ARG_OPTION_ARG macro so that it uses _ instead of - for
	the word separator in multi-word options.

2015-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for	distclean and the modules build.

2015-01-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed dist-hook which as a hack for SVN

2015-01-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed bad gdal_das.cc after dap4 branch merge
	The file 'lost' some fixes: sprint --> snprint was lost as
	was a fix to remove double quotes from String attribute values.

	Merged with dap4 branch
	This merge did not go smoothly and I'm still not sure why. Serveral
	of the files (GDALArray.cc, gdal_dds.cc, gdal_das.cc) had large
	parts that were not merged at all. I copied them by hand from the
	dap4 branch and verified that they worked. This fixes issues with
	tests as well as larger issues with dap4 compatibility.

2014-12-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed Makefile.am and configure.ac after merging with the modules branch

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/modules'

2014-12-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added module name and version info to Makefile.am
	This change was made to support the modules build where the autoconf
	symbols PACKAGE_NAME and _MODULE are defined by the bes configure
	script. This meant that the version response from the bes was useless
	since it listed every module as 'bes' and gave the bes' version
	number.

2014-12-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated	the spec file to release 2.

	Bumped up the libdap and bes versions in the spec file

2014-11-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added gdal_handler to the bes modules build.

	gdal_handler: Checking software version update and associated release changes.
2013-11-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the pec file to use the current name of the gdal package in the
	dependencies.

	M    gdal_handler.spec

2013-10-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Edits to match the new, sane, semantics for BaseType::read(). True
	now means done/eof and flase means more data to read (more
	instances for a sequence). All the tests pass.

2013-10-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the FSF address in the copyright headers

2013-09-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	svn ignore updated; minor change in GDALArray.cc (using <> for an include)

2013-09-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This handler used a bogus definition of BaseType::read() which caused various warnings with clang 5.

2013-09-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	removed -fno-defer-pop from all copies of Makefile.am since the
	new OSX compiler prints warnings about it and it seems to not make
	a difference with newer g++ versions.

	Update of the tests directory - now it has a test
	program (tests/testsuite) that can also generate baselines for
	given bescmd files. look at the --generate and --generate-data
	options (--help)

	people use.

	more svn nonsense

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the name of the shared object library so it's called
	libgdal_module.so like all the other modules (it was also called
	that in the gdal.conf file that was installed by default).

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Maybe now, with the previously hidden files ignored, the SVN stuff
	will appear correctly in Eclipse

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Set svn ignore on many files in an attempt to get Eclipse to show
	modification status correctly.

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ignored files...

2012-07-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hack that might fix the dataset name problem - made at home and
	the new BES hacks this handler needs are not in SVN yet...

2012-07-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	fixed leaking resource problem: The handler depended on being able
	to keep the file open when accessing data (this was OK in the
	original version because the handler was a CGI and the file was
	closed each time the handler/program exited). I subclassed DataDDS
	so that the open GDAL handler for the dataset is closed using the
	DataDDS (really GDALDDS) destructor. I fixed a slew of memory
	leaks in the old code, and in the process, found a bug in libdap.
	This handler requires libdap >= 3.12.0

2012-07-25  brent

	Changes to the Grid constructor to allow the Grid to open and
	close the input itself. Fails in DODS case

2012-06-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Some minor changes like adding #define DODS_DEBUG and then
	commenting it out. The only substantial changes are to GDALGrid
	where I fixed the signature of read() and added my own impls of
	the copy ctor and operator=. Changing the type signature of read()
	fixed the bug that was making the data requests barf.

2012-06-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes made during some debugging work. Added instrumentation and
	hacked up some stuff in tests, data directories. It seems that
	there is a 'slicing' bug in the code when instances of GDDALGrid
	are added to the DDS object, although I do not where/how this is
	happening.

2012-06-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes to the bes.conf.in file plus some new tests (bescmd
	scripts in tests/gdal).

2012-06-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hacked bes.conf.in and Makefile.am here in tests so that they work.
