To build the gdal handler, follow the usual prescription of running 
./configure followed by make and make install.

This handler uses the GDAL library to access several different types
of data files: GeoTIFF, GRiB and JPEG2000. The build also
supports access to data in SQLite and Postgres, although that has not
been tested.

To build the handler so that it uses a copy of GDAL already installed
on the host computer, simply run ./configure. It will use configure's
normal rules to find a copy of the library installed in a standard 
location. To build the handler so that it uses a particular copy of
GDAL, use the --with-gdal=PATH option to ./configure, where PATH is
the pathname where GDAL is/was installed.

The handler can also be built so that it uses its own copy of the 
GDAL library. To do this, use the --enable-local-gdal option. When
this is used, a local copy of GDAL will be built *when ./configure 
is run* which is a little different than the normal build order, but
ensure that the GDAL library is completely built before the handler
software. When this option is used, the GDAL library is configured
so as to build only its static version and is installed in the 
gdal-<version>/build subdirectory.

  o You should have gcc/g++ 3.3.x or greater. You'll also need to get
    the stdc++ library that matches the compiler (whatever version).
    NB: gcc 2.8.x and earlier *won't* build the software. We're
    working on modifying the software so that it will build with a
    variety of compilers. As of 01/22/03 we have built the code using
    Microsoft's Visual C++ 6.0 and GNU gcc/++ 3.2.1, 3.3, 3.4 and 4.0.
    This code has also been built on OSX 10.9 using Apple LLVM version
    5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn).
