Updated for version 1.0.4

This is the OPeNDAP csv Data Handler. It is used along with OPeNDAP Hyrax.

For information about building the OPeNDAP csv Data Handler, see the
INSTALL file.

This data handler is a component of the OPeNDAP DAP Server; the server base
software is designed to allow any number of handlers to be configured easily.
See the DAP Server README and INSTALL files for information about
configuration, including how to use this handler.

Test data are also installed, so after installing this handler, Hyrax 
will have data to serve providing an easy way to test your new installation
and to see how a working csv.conf should look. To use this, make sure
that you first install the bes, and that dap-server gets installed too.
Finally, every time you install or reinstall handlers, make sure to restart
the BES and OLFS.

Also, for this initial release, the test data are the documentation
for the handler. We will include more documentation on our web site at
http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/Hyrax when it is available.
