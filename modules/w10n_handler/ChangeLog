2015-12-28  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Patched error handling problems in Transmitter implmentations. In particular: 
	1) Ensured that libdap::Error objects are converted to BESDapError objects 
	when caught. and 2) Catch and rethrow BESError objects whenever they could 
	be thrown so they don't get swept up as unidentified errors in a catch(...) 
	clause.

	Update for bes 3.16.0 release
2015-10-01  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of
	changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and
	BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression
	cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache
	configuration collisions with various handlers that also were
	utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by
	calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir,
	BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we
	specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from
	the other caches.

2015-09-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2015-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Rebuilt data/atomicTypes.nc as a netCDF4 file.
	This is a work around for an odd issue I'm blaming on the
	netcdf 4.1.1 rpm.

	Replaced the atomicTypes netCDF3 file with a netCDF4 version.
	This problem - the netcdf handler not reading integer variables
	from a netcdf 3 file - only shows up here with the file build
	using ncgen. Other netcdf3 files work fine. I'm blaming this on
	netcdf 4.1.1, which had some issues...

	Fix for	distclean and the modules build.

2015-03-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added 'pattern' test to w10n tests
	The test coads_SST_data.bescmd results in an (intentional) error. I
	added a Pattern rule to the *.at test file so that the build options,
	etc., will not make differences in the output that will make the test
	erroneously fail. I only modified one test to use the new rule; all
	tests pass on my version of the master branch.
