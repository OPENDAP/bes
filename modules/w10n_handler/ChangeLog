	Merge pull request #59 from OPENDAP/cache_fix
	Cache fix

	Clean up residual cache code. Add a note about fcntl(2) versus flock(2)
	Both fcntl(2) and flock(2) can be used for advisory locking. The
	BESFileLockingCache uses fcntl() and that impacts testing since
	all of our testing is single-process. Not a huge deal, but if we
	want more complete testing we'll need to change how we implement
	the locks or use multi-process testing.

	Modest fixes to the test code in cacheT

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/cacheT_fix' into cache_fix

	This code now builds and passes the tests we have...
	But we might ned or want to write more/better tests for the cache.

2017-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix to BESFSDir for the opendir/readdir race condition.
	When two processes are using the same directory and one process makes
	and deletes files in the directory at the same time as the other
	process uses opendir/readdir to iterate over the files in the
	directory, it's possible for file names to show up in entries returned
	by readdir that no longer exist (i.e., stat(2) returns -1). It's better
	to ignore this than signal an error (IMHO).

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:/opendap/bes

	Removed errant tab in Makefile.am

	Fixed an error in both scale_util.cc and its test code (ScaleUtilTest.cc)
	In scale_util.cc:get_gcp_data() the code samples the data and uses
	both integer division and 'increment by sample factor' and those
	were producing an off by one error in some cases.

	Removed ScaleUtilTest from bes/functions for now.

	Fixed BesDebug --> BESDebug and removed some generated files.

	Ugh. Still recovering from geo-functions merge mess - removed generatged files
	... From gateway bes-testsuite

	Added bes-testsuite for w10n handler

	Added the bes-testsuite dir back in for the gateway handler

2017-03-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed all the unused lines from the pvolT BES keys file

	Patched the pvolT test so that it writes temp files to ./cache
	This keeps those temp files from conflicting with the BESKeys use of
	a regex in the BES.Include line in one of it's test files. This is not
	a real fix for the problem, which will take a bit more time - and an
	understanding of the BES File and Dir classes...

	Fixed the various badness of my previous merge of geo-functions.

	OK. Added the gateway and w10n handlers back in.

2017-03-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added comment to ContainerStorageVolatile about needing BESKeys file

	pvolT now uses separate tests.
	I'm not sure this really addresses the underlying issue with the pvolT
	and keysT conflict, but is makes the test cleaner and might help debug
	the issue.

	Added options to unit-tests keysT and pvolT

2017-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Unit tests in dispatch fail when run in parallel. This is a fix.
	The setup() code in pvolT seems to conflict with the code in keysT
	when keysT starts and then pvolT starts and finishes before keysT
	finishes. I have no idea why, but the text in the pvolT's setup()
	shows up in keysT. It turns out that the setup() code is not needed,
	and removing it seems to fix the problem. Seems to...

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of
	changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and
	BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression
	cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache
	configuration collisions with various handlers that also were
	utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by
	calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir,
	BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we
	specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from
	the other caches.

	Rebuilt data/atomicTypes.nc as a netCDF4 file.
	This is a work around for an odd issue I'm blaming on the
	netcdf 4.1.1 rpm.

	Replaced the atomicTypes netCDF3 file with a netCDF4 version.
	This problem - the netcdf handler not reading integer variables
	from a netcdf 3 file - only shows up here with the file build
	using ncgen. Other netcdf3 files work fine. I'm blaming this on
	netcdf 4.1.1, which had some issues...

	Fix for	distclean and the modules build.

2015-03-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added 'pattern' test to w10n tests
	The test coads_SST_data.bescmd results in an (intentional) error. I
	added a Pattern rule to the *.at test file so that the build options,
	etc., will not make differences in the output that will make the test
	erroneously fail. I only modified one test to use the new rule; all
	tests pass on my version of the master branch.
