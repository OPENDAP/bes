On CentOS 6 three of the w10n tests fail because the netcdf handler
cannot read the integer variables in the data file 'atomicTypes.nc
_when it is a netCDF 3 file_. However, when it is a netCDF4 file it
has no problem reading the variables. For now I'm moving the original
file to *.nc.3 and adding a netcdf 4 version as *.nc
