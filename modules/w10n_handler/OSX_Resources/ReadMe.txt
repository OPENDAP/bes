See the INSTALL file for build and installation instructions.

w10n is a handler to be loaded by the BES that will allow users navigate the server's holdings and retrieve data using the w10n protocol. 

An example is provided in the BES command line input file infile, which generates the file outfile. This is how one would use this input file:

bescmdln -h localhost -p 10002 -i infile -f outfile.test

And then you can compare the results of outfile with outfile.test. 

How does it work?

TBD
