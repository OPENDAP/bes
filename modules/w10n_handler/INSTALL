BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

0) Please skim REQUIREMENTS and NOTES sections of this file before reporting
   problems. Thanks.

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
   type `sh configure.' If you want this part of the server to install
   someplace other than /usr/local/bin, use --prefix to change the prefix
   from the default "/use/local/." 

2) Type `make' to build the handler

3) Install the server component in $prefix by running `make install.'
   This will also add the new fonc.conf file to the $prefix/etc/bes/modules
   directory. The BES configuration file bes.conf will automatically
   load any module configuration files in that directory. The fonc.conf
   file contains fileout_netcdf specific configurations for use with the
   BES Framework. This includes some parameters that used to be in the
   bes.conf file, such as the TypeMatch parameter for finding your
   files.

4) For some installations, you must arrange for your operating system to find
   the shared libraries installed by default in $prefix/lib. Do this by
   either setting an environment variable such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH or by
   editing /etc/ld.so.conf. Different operating systems handle this in
   different ways.

Building from Our SVN Repository

  If you are building from a SVN checkout, run 'autoreconf --verbose' before
  './configure; make'. If you try to run autoconf, et c., by hand and wind up
  with build files that don't work, use 'autoreconf --force --verbose'. Once
  autoreconf has made the configure and Makefile.in files, do ./configure;
  make; make install as outlined above.

REQUIREMENTS

  o You need the libdap library version 3.13.x to build and install this
    software. If you're using Linux, this means either building from source
    or using the libdap and libdap-devel RPM packages.

  o You will need the OPeNDAP Back-End Server (BES) libraries version
    3.13.x to build and install this software. If you're using Linux,
    this means either building from source or using the bes and bes-devel
    RPM packages.

NOTES

  o DEBUGGING AIDS: Use the bes/besstandalone logging symbol "w10n" to
    see instrumentation output.
