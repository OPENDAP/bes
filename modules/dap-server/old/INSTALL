BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

  To build the OPeNDAP Server Base Software, follow these steps:

  0. Please skim REQUIREMENTS and NOTES sections of this file
     before reporting problems. Thanks. If you're build this as part of Hyrax
     (aka the OPeNDAP 4 Data Server) then make usre you have first built and
     installed the appropriate version of the BES. If you have installed the
     bes in a 'special' place sure that <prefix>/bin is on your PATH 
     environment variable _before_ running configure. That will ensure that
     configure find the bes and builds the plugins need for Hyrax.

  1. Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have
     to type `sh configure'.

  2. Type `make' to build the software, `make check' to test the
     software. You must have the GNU automated testing software
     'autotest' (part of autoconf 2.63) and the CppUnit library to run
     all the tests. If you have neither, then the tests won't yield
     useful results.

  3. Type `make install' to install the software. This will move the handlers
     to the $prefix/lib/bes directory where the BES will find them. It will
     also install a bes configuration file in to the bes configuration
     directory and install some sample data in 
  
  4. See the file README for important information about configuration of the
     server. Without those extra steps, the server will not work!

REQUIREMENTS

  o The Server Base Software uses libdap 3.13.0 or greater. You must install
    that software. See http://www.opendap.org/download/.
    
  o To build this as part of Hyrax, you need the bes, version 3.13.0
  and a modern version of Perl (the software no longer uses Perl at
  runtime, but we still use it for building the HTML form software).

  o You should have gcc/g++ 2.95.x or greater. You'll also need to get
    the stdc++ library that matches the compiler (whatever version).
    In most cases it's part of the compiler. NB: gcc 2.8.x and earlier
    *won't* build the software. We're working on modifying the
    software so that it will build with a variety of compilers. As of
    02/27/06 we have built the code using Microsoft's Visual C++ 6.0
    and GNU gcc/++ 3.2.1, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, ..., 4.4 and  Apple
    LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn) that
    comes with OSX 10.9.

  o If you're building from SVN or need/want to hack the configure.ac,
    acinclude.m4, et c., files, you will need the GNU auto tools 
    (autoconf 2.63 and its associated programs) . Use autoreconf to rebuild
    configure; if you call autoconf directly the aclocal.m4 file won't get
    built from acinclude.m4 correctly.

NOTES

  o If you are building on a new platform (one for which we don't supply
    binaries), please run the tests and tell us about any failures. To do a
    really complete job of this you'll need to get the GNU test system called
    DejaGNU and CppUnit. It is very simple to install these and we're very
    willing to help, so don't be shy!
