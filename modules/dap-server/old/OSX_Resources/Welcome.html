<h2>About the OPeNDAP dap-server package</h2>

<p>This software is used by two projects: The original OPeNDAP Data Server,
which used CGI 1.1 in conjunction with a web server such as Apache, and the
new data server (Hyrax) which uses Java Servlets in combination with the
Earth System Grid/OPeNDAP Back-End Server (BES). This package contains
general purpose handlers for use with either of the two servers. These are
the Usage, ASCII and HTML form handlers. Each takes input from a 'data
handler' and returns a HTML or plain text response --- something other than
a DAP response object.</p>

<p>This software also contains the 'dispatch' software for the original OPeNDAP
data server, comprised of several Perl modules and the Perl program 'nph-dods'.
All of this software is included when you get the source code distribution.
However, when you get the RPM packages or OS/X disk images (.dmg files), the 
CGI server software is separated in a package named 'dap-server-cgi'. The 
binary programs and libraries for both servers are in the 'dap-server'. In a
future version we will move the binaries used by the cgi-based server to the
cgi package.</p>

<p>To install dap-server please read the Readme file provided with this
distribution. See <a href="http://www.opendap.org/">OpeNDAP web site </a> for more
information.</p>
