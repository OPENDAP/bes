/** This class can be used to build up a simple thesaurus which maps names
    from one string to another. The thesaurus is built by calling the #add#
    mfunc with a string of the form <source>:<dest> where <source> and <dest>
    are string literals. Once the thesaurus is built, the #lookup# mfunc can
    be used to get the equivalent of any string in the thesaurus.

    As an additional feature, this class can canonicalize an identifier
    (remove non-alphanumeric characters) when performing the lookup
    operation. This is performed as a separate step from the thesaurus scan
    so words with no entry in the thesaurus will still be canonicalized.

    You can interleave calls to #add# and calls to #lookup#.
