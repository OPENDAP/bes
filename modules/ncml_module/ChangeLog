	Merge pull request #59 from OPENDAP/cache_fix
	Cache fix

	Clean up residual cache code. Add a note about fcntl(2) versus flock(2)
	Both fcntl(2) and flock(2) can be used for advisory locking. The
	BESFileLockingCache uses fcntl() and that impacts testing since
	all of our testing is single-process. Not a huge deal, but if we
	want more complete testing we'll need to change how we implement
	the locks or use multi-process testing.

	Modest fixes to the test code in cacheT

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/cacheT_fix' into cache_fix

	This code now builds and passes the tests we have...
	But we might ned or want to write more/better tests for the cache.

2017-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix to BESFSDir for the opendir/readdir race condition.
	When two processes are using the same directory and one process makes
	and deletes files in the directory at the same time as the other
	process uses opendir/readdir to iterate over the files in the
	directory, it's possible for file names to show up in entries returned
	by readdir that no longer exist (i.e., stat(2) returns -1). It's better
	to ignore this than signal an error (IMHO).

	Added ScaleUtilTest back into the build

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:/opendap/bes

	Removed errant tab in Makefile.am

	Fixed an error in both scale_util.cc and its test code (ScaleUtilTest.cc)
	In scale_util.cc:get_gcp_data() the code samples the data and uses
	both integer division and 'increment by sample factor' and those
	were producing an off by one error in some cases.

	Removed ScaleUtilTest from bes/functions for now.

	Fixed BesDebug --> BESDebug and removed some generated files.

	Ugh. Still recovering from geo-functions merge mess - removed generatged files
	... From gateway bes-testsuite

	Added bes-testsuite for w10n handler

	Added the bes-testsuite dir back in for the gateway handler

2017-03-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed all the unused lines from the pvolT BES keys file

	Patched the pvolT test so that it writes temp files to ./cache
	This keeps those temp files from conflicting with the BESKeys use of
	a regex in the BES.Include line in one of it's test files. This is not
	a real fix for the problem, which will take a bit more time - and an
	understanding of the BES File and Dir classes...

	Fixed the various badness of my previous merge of geo-functions.

	OK. Added the gateway and w10n handlers back in.

2017-03-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added comment to ContainerStorageVolatile about needing BESKeys file

	pvolT now uses separate tests.
	I'm not sure this really addresses the underlying issue with the pvolT
	and keysT conflict, but is makes the test cleaner and might help debug
	the issue.

	Added options to unit-tests keysT and pvolT

2017-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Unit tests in dispatch fail when run in parallel. This is a fix.
	The setup() code in pvolT seems to conflict with the code in keysT
	when keysT starts and then pvolT starts and finishes before keysT
	finishes. I have no idea why, but the text in the pvolT's setup()
	shows up in keysT. It turns out that the setup() code is not needed,
	and removing it seems to fix the problem. Seems to...

	Amended error message for type match conflicts so that it's more informative.

2015-10-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I modified NCMLDebug.h so that the NCML_ASSERT() macros use NDEBUG
	That is, so that when NDEBUG is defined, the assertions are not used,
	as would be the case if assert() was used. The bes configure script
	--enable-developer controls whether NDEBUG is defined.

	Fix for HR-64. The DDSLoader class was not closing the cached uompressed file.
	HR-64 has more details, but the short version is that DDSLoader::
	restoreDHI() was not calling BESContainer::release(). Now it is
	and all of the four cases in the ticket can run without any left over
	open files. (but see HR-65 - bes.conf and bes.log are open multiple
	times, which seems odd).

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache configuration collisions with various handlers that also were utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir, BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from the other caches.

	Rewinding changes for BESFileLocking API in favor of less invasive use of the cache prefix as base for control file name.

2015-09-29  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Refactored code to eliminate changes to the API

	Refactored dimension caching to use a child of BESFileLockingCache for multiprocess safety. Works. woot.

2015-09-26  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Small changes to dimension caching

2015-09-24  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Merged master to joinExisiting_improvements branch

	Reworked caching to use a separate disk file for each granule's (data file's) dimension cache. This way if the file is used in multiple aggregations it only needs a single cache, if the file get's dropped from the aggregation (ala FMRC) no harm is done, and if the source data for a single granule/file changes then only that one dimension cache file needs to be updated.

2015-09-23  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	First crack at caching granule dimensions is working

2015-09-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes to Makefile.am in the autotest dirs; clean removes bes.conf

2015-09-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'pipelining' to master

	Fixed Makefile.am in tests so distcheck works

2015-08-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes to match the Parallel I/O code refactor in libdap.

2015-08-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Use parallel I/O interface of Marshaller in the PIPELINING code

2015-08-21  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Disabled prototype code for correctly renaming structures and
	grids without 'prereading' their data. The protoype implmentation
	is incomplete and not used.

2015-08-19  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Merged github for James' changes.

	 merged from github

2015-08-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Another fix for set_read_p() in the Array aggregation classes.

	Fixed a minor error in the Array aggregation classes
	The read_p predicate was not set correctly in the !PIPELINING
	case and clear_local_data() was called when libdap::Array::serialize()
	would have done it.

2015-08-19  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added triggers (delete calls) for the global timing variables so
	that time to first read and time to first transmit are computed.

2015-08-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed unused code in AggregationUtil; added instrumentation
	...to my new 'pipelining' code so I can see it getting called.
	I can, it is. Remove this once we merge.

	Put calls to clear_local_data() back in the code - were lost in
	the shuffle During the merge of the master branch to this branch,
	I lost the calls to clear_local_data() that were put inthe
	overloaded serialize() methods in the ArrayAggregation... classes.
	I've added them back, in the correct places I hope.

	Added a commet and the new pipelining serialize()

	Pipelining for Grids now works.

	Code formatting in GridAgg...

	JoinExisting aggregations now support pipelining

	Comment updates plus one minor fix to use code in AggregationUtil
	The later ensures a small memory footprint when code calls the
	read() method (which will read the entire data for an aggregated
	variable into memory).

	Merge branch 'master' into double_buffer
	 Conflicts:
		NCMLArray.h
		RenamedArrayWrapper.cc
		RenamedArrayWrapper.h
	There were many conflicts in the latter two files, so I used
	'git checkout master -- RenamedArrayWrapper.cc' (also for the .h)
	to simply pull the versions from the current master branch. The
	code passes all its tests.

	Modified ArrayAggregateOnOuterDimension::serialize() so it works!
	The new code handles the case when code in
	GridAggregateOnOuterDimension calls ArrayAgg...::read(). We can
	fix teh GridAgg... code later but this gets all the tests working
	and the improvement of interleaved reads and writes in place for
	at least the tests for 'pure' arrays. (join new aggregations
	only).

2015-08-17  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Empty commit to end a failed merge

	Merge branch 'serialize_n_release'

2015-08-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Checkpoint: more work on interleaving data reads and writes

2015-08-17  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Somehow git wants me to commit a file that I don't understand why - nthgin ahs changed. meh.

	Removed expected failures of the BES-7 (Werpy's) bug. Now all tests pass correctly.

2015-08-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Fixed ncml_module::RenamedArrayWrapper to correctly override the libdap:Vector::value() and  libdap:Vector::set_value() methods. This was accomplished by making the use of templates in libdap::Vector private and adding virtual functions for all of the various overloaded versions of libdap::Vector::value() and libdap::Vector::set_value (one version for each DAP atomic type). This fixes the JSON output for renamed array's, but unfortunately not the ascii output.

2015-08-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Interleaved reads and accumulation for Join New
	The code in ArrayAggregateOnOuterDimension::serialize() is close to
	providing interleaved (file) read / (socket) write behavior. Some
	aspects of libdap are not cooperating, but that's all. In particular,
	Marshaller::put_vector() is limited by its baskic design of writing
	the array size and data atomically. For this modification to the NCML
	handler, we need to write the size of the data blob to be sent and
	then make several calls to write the actual data.

	Reformatting and simple modifications in preparation for double buffering
	I reformated more of the source files, using hte OPeNDAP_Eclipse...xml
	settings and changed how NCMLRequestHandler.cc builds the DDS response
	to match the simpler way it builds the DataDDS response.

2015-08-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added instrumentation

	Added instrumentation

	Added a crucial call to clear_local_data()

2015-08-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Swapped back into the code the modified/refactored RenamedArrayWrapper class

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/ncml_module

	I moved unused classes to the 'not_used' directory

	I reformated about 80% of the .cc and .h files fr readability
	...using the OPeNDAP_Eclipse_C_Formatting.xml setting that I added
	to the bes repo. If only I could eclpse to reformat all the files.

	I reverted the RenameArrayWrapper class changes, saving them in files named *.modified

2015-08-10  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Disabled cruft code, comments

2015-08-06  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Removed NCMLBaseArray::createFromArray() method from code base.

2015-08-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Second pass at cleaning up RenamedArrayWrapper class

	Second pass at cleaning up RenamedArrayWrapper class

	First cut at cleaning up RenamedArrayWrapper class

	Documentation...

2015-08-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed package.m4 in the autoconf dirs Makefile.am files

2015-07-30  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Started on code to handle the renaming of complex types.

	Added debugging keyword control to the preloading of renamed arrays. Keyword is no_preload_for_renamed_arrays

2015-07-24  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added OS-X .DS_Store to the ignore list

	Added OS-X .DS_Store to the ignore list

	Post serialization call to clear_local_data() now runtime switchable

2015-07-22  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added call to clear_local_data() post serialization. This can be controled by adding the debug flag clear_local_data

2015-07-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed forward class decl
	Use namespace libdap { class ...; } and not libdap::...

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/ncml_module

	Added files related to agg performance improvements

	Fixed the URL in joinNew_scan_dfm.ncml

2015-07-09  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	More instrumentation. I think with this all major activities are now inside timing blocks.

2015-07-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'timing_instrumentation'

	Added a call to xmlCleanupParser in the module's terminate() function.
	This fixes a memory leak that is not really that big a deal,
	bug why not fix it? The leak is for a constant amount of
	memory per-process (I think) and the only real issue is if
	that's not true or if we might initialize the library more
	than once. Anyway, it's called now by NCMLModule's terminate
	and also in the server abnd besstandalone App code.

	Arrgh... bungled the name change of (now) valgrind_osx_libxml_bes.txt

	Fiddled with the valgrind suppression files for OSX

2015-07-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'timing_instrumentation'
	Had to fix an errant change to DDSLoader made back in the
	timing_leaks_fixes (local) branch that was then merged to
	timing_instrumentation before being merged to master. Gads.

	Mistake fixed: Broken version of DDSLoader fixed
	On the timing_leak_fixes local branch I commited (and then merged that
	branch to timing_instr...) a version of DDSLoader that used
	Request_handler-->TheList()->execute_each() instead of
	...->execute_current(). Fixed. So, now this code passes it's tests
	again, and the leak I found in DDSLoader is patched.

	Revert "Fixed a memory leak in DDSLoader"
	This reverts commit 5f8f1addc64abcdd03fc89aa5c9cabfd0b11cf94.
	I merged my timing_memory_leak branch back into the
	timing_instrumentation branch and then merged that back into
	the master. Not so good. I'm hoping this 'git revert' will get
	us back to having the master branch pass its tests. I can then
	sort out the problems on the timing_instr... branch.

2015-07-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a memory leak in DDSLoader

2015-06-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a leak in DDSLoader
	The BESContainerVolatileStorage::look_for() method returns a
	pointer to a copy of the BESContainer but this code was not
	recording that so it could delete it later on. I also added a
	small aggregation to test for leaks and a valgrind suppressions
	file to cut down on the noise from valgrind on OSX 10.10 and
	from the BES (which still does not completely cleanup after
	itself).

2015-06-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	More instrumentation tweaks for AWS system.

	More instrumentation tweaks for AWS system.

	More instrumentation tweaks for AWS system.

	Timing Instrumentation.

2015-05-22  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/ncml_module

	Added new BESStopWatch support.

2015-05-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Replaced the call to mktemp with one that calls mkstemps()
	From a bug report by O. Poplawski. The new code to make a
	temp file using mkstemps() is in libdap::util.cc

2015-04-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/ncml_module

	Modified Makefile.am to support bes distcheck

2015-04-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	version 1.2.5
2015-03-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added to gitignore

2015-03-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Accommodate autoconf 2.63
	Removed -j7 from TESTSUITEFLAGS. Can still pass them in from the
	command line (make check TESTSUITEFLAGS=-j7).

2015-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for	distclean and the modules build.

2015-02-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tests that fail for DAP4 marked xfail
	In the *.at files, search for FIXME DAP4 FAILURES
	to find the specific tests. I think all of the
	failures have to do with the errors in caching Vectors
	when the ncml code reads all of the array data and
	then reuses that later when the aggregation is formed.

2015-01-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed dist-hook which as a hack for SVN

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/dap4'
	Conflicts:
		configure.ac
	Fixed errors with some DAS tests where the order of attributes
	was different for one variable after the merge with DAP4. This
	different ordering was due to a switch in attribute internal
	representation.

2014-12-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed configure.ac and bes.conf.in after merging with the modules branch

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/modules'

2014-12-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added module name and version info to Makefile.am
	This change was made to support the modules build where the autoconf
	symbols PACKAGE_NAME and _MODULE are defined by the bes configure
	script. This meant that the version response from the bes was useless
	since it listed every module as 'bes' and gave the bes' version
	number.

2014-12-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated	the spec file to release 2.

	Updated the spec file for hyrax 1.10

2014-12-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for the bes modules build.

2014-09-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added some dap4 test stuff using dapreader - just a start.

	Removed the old OPENDAP_DEBUG_OPTIONS macro from many configure.ac files. Fixed some param initializations; method overloads (virtual methods that lacked 'const'). Other warnings.

2014-05-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes	after merging the trunk	code (H	1.9.3) to the dap4 branch. Note that the dap4 branch is using a 'branched' version of the ncml handler - all the other handlers are trunk versions.

	Removed the changes I added to the trunk that corrected the tests for
	the dap4 branch. I've moved the tests to a branch version of the ncml
	module for the dap4 work. This way the tests work there and here too.

	Modified the baselines - there's some reason why the added attr containers
	are showing up in a diffent place, but the difference should matter to
	clients.

2011-12-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for the broken test - ticket 1868 - where top-level
	attributes were not renamed correctly. The problem was that the
	tests were being run using the new option to dump all the those
	attributes in a container named NC_GLOBAL.  I modified the tests
	so that we can use different configuration files - useful I
	think. I also verified that the test could be rewritten to rename
	the attribute if it was added NC_GLOBAL using the nested notation
	our ncml handler supports. I also fixed an issue with the way the
	option to trigger the new behavior was working - if the attribute
	was not set the default was to make the NC_GLOBAL container, which
	was not correct.

	Working on tickets 1849, 51 and 52. Partial check in. The
	following tests fail for the listed/suspected reasons: These all
	have to do with the OtherXML attribute type: 39 41 43 44 47 58 60

	Only difference is the order of the NC_GLOBAL and other containers: 318 320 354

	Fixed, bad baseline 356 359 361 369 371 375 560 562 565 567

	I think these are still broken 581 585 586 587

	Fixed, bad baseline, but double check 589 591 593 failed

	Added a method to AggregationUtil so that the ordering of the
	Coordinate Variables can be controlled. I was using a static int
	and while this worked for the first call, subsequent calls were
	trying to insert the CVs in places that did not exist. See the
	method: void AggregationUtil::resetCVInsertionPosition() for more
	information.

2011-10-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed ticket 1803 - now when a Grid is built the handler adds
	top-level arrays for the 'coordinate variables' in the correct
	order and at the 'top' of the DDS. This is quite complex and
	really a hack; it will need to be revisited so that DAP 3.3+
	clients _don't_ get this stuff, but that will be easy enough since
	it involves just not doing the hacky bits. Later... Fixed some DDX
	tests to work with the new libdap code.

	include of algorithm needed for sort method
	M    AggMemberDatasetWithDimensionCacheBase.cc

2011-02-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	removed unneeded mime_util.h and util.h includes; added comments about sending mime headers in our handlers (which may not be needed).

2011-01-31  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Fixed macro bug in code
	M    NCMLResponseNames.h

2011-01-07  mjohnson

	Placeholder for join existing cache file system for saving the dimension cache in the AggMemberDataset to a binary file and reloading it later.  Commented out, in progress.

2011-01-05  mjohnson

	o Refactor to allow joinExisting to load dimension sizes from DDX. (ticket #1674).

	o Tests for this

	o Initial skeleton code for save/load of this dimension cache to allow for #1632 the caching of this slow load.

	o Initial stub for a cacheAgg XML command on the module which will be hooked up to force a cache to be created from this slow load if the file contains a joinExisting agg in it.

2011-01-03  mjohnson

	o Fixed seg fault bug due to invalid iterator state caused by unsafe object mutation during iteration.

2010-12-20  mjohnson

	o Self-contained changes to add a WeakRCPtr<T> class as a peer or RCPtr<T> to handle circular references for ref-counted objects.  Similar to boost::weak_ptr.

2010-11-17  mjohnson

	o Removed function name in error response for parse error due to distracting verbosity.  Left for internal errors since this will be useful in a bug report.

2010-11-11  mjohnson

	* More error checking for Ticket #1666.

2010-11-11  mjohnson

	* Support for Ticket #1666 to make repro case in the testsuite.  Now the bes.conf for the testsuite also loads the fileout_netcdf  module.  We did not add an autotest for it yet however.

2010-11-11  mjohnson

	* Fix for Ticket #1666, a null pointer deref when a wrapped dataset is passed through the FONC return transmitter.

2010-10-29  mjohnson

	MERGE from the RELEASE branch for Hyrax 1.6.2 (shrew)

2010-09-14  mjohnson

	Updated to require libdap 3.11.0 and bes 3.9.0.

2010-09-13  mjohnson

	o Changes to prepare for release.  Note: libdap and bes requires (versions) not updated in configure.ac nor ncml_module.spec in this changeset.

2010-09-03  mjohnson

	o Modified exception macros to add function names automatically to help debugging and cleaned out resulting dead code.

2010-09-03  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Modified exception macros to add function names automatically to help debugging and cleaned out resulting dead code.

2010-09-01  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Changes for ticket #1626 to allow metadata to be specified on a placeholder coordinate variable for the aggregated joinExisting dimension and then applied all all Grid map vectors.

	o NCMLDebug.h: changes to debug exception macros to print the function name for errors so we don't have to do so in every function.

2010-08-26  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Implementation and test for scan@ncoords syntactic sugar extension.  Ticket #1613.

2010-08-25  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Fixes and data constraint tests for Grid joinExisting on netcdf Grid granules.   Tests for various constraints.   Does not include code for user specification of the joined coordinate variable, only implementation for automatically creating the aggregation from the granules themselves.

	o tests/make_test_grids.rb: ruby script using netcdf bindings in order to create simple test Grids.  Requires bindings installed, checked in since it's useful and I don't want it lost.

2010-08-19  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	For ticket #1631.  Nightly build error on test 533, where netcdf@ncoords is negative.  This is supposed to be a parse error, but some compilers seems to implictly convert it to an unsigned int rather than making an error.  Did not duplicate in CentOS.  Added a check for the explicit '-' sign in the coords to force the error.

2010-08-18  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Incremental checkin with initial codepaths for Grid joinExisting passing previous tests.

	o Grid joinExisting DDS response works.  DAS/DDX unknown, need testing.

	o DODS response is currently NOT implemented and throws as such.

	o Tests not fully integrated yet.

2010-08-18  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Potential fix for Linux build fails, for ticket #1631.

2010-08-13  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Initial changes for #1620.  We now only output specified vars in variableAgg if joinExisting declares it.  Still outputs vars not in aggregqation.  Still needs changes and tests to handle coordinate variables!

2010-08-12  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o New tests to make sure the AggMemberDataset pathway loading files from disk (Netcdf in this case) works for joinExisting.  Small sets, testing with full data and simple constraint.  Ticket #1623

	o Also getting the (non working and non connected in aggregations.at) tests for variableAgg.  Those will come later.

2010-08-11  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Test added that successfully tests for multiple variables with given outer dimension getting aggregated.  #1628.  Variables without matching dimension get added from the first dataset ONLY.  <variableAgg> not support yet.

2010-08-11  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Basic implementation of joinExisting for Array datatypes for ticket #1624

	o Test cases for joinExisting on virtual data Array's.

	o Added dimension size cache to AggMemberDataset to help with joinExisting

	o Added ncoords to netcdf element.

2010-07-15  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Added include of dependent dap.conf

2010-07-14  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o AggregationUtil.cc: fixed some incorrect exception text and converted exceptions over to AggregationException.

	o {Array,Grid}AggregateOnOuterDimension.{cc,h}: Removed dead functions from previous refactor that were  accidentally left in.

2010-07-14  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	tests/aggregations.at:  For ticket #1575: removed hack from read parse error tests for joinNew now that #1574 is fixed.  NOTE: these tests will now FAIL for BES 3.8.4 release and earlier.  Only pass in the trunk!

	Several new tests for joinNew and for ticket #1581.

2010-07-02  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Final changes for #1448.

2010-06-11  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Initial changes for #1448 and #1533.

	o ArrayAggregateOnOuterDimension: added to support efficient joinNew on Array datasets similarly to GridAggregateOnOuterDimension.  Now only the constrained subset of data is loaded on read() and serialize() and not the entire dataset prior to constraint application as old code.

	o Added initial support for nested aggregations.  Was required to pass old Array joinNew tests since they used virtual data (effectively nesting) and the old joinNew code asssumed member datasets were external files and not libdap::BaseType subclasses.

	o Added several interface classes to avoid backdependencies from agg_util into ncml_module.

	o NCMLParser: Removed the RCObjectPool memory pool since the objects are now required AFTER NCMLParser dtor would delete the pool -- serialize() and read() calls occur after this.  Consider a static pool in the future, though this is dangerous in a threaded situation without using boost threadsafe containers.

	o tests/aggregations.at:  Changed several tests for joinNew on Array where member dataset types and shapes were mismatched since they were failing with the optimization.  Since the BES handles errors differently in the read() and serialize() section of code, BESSyntaxUserError which we use for Parse Error response gets eaten.  Made ticket to fix this, but tests are modified for now to make sure we at least get a fatal error rather than streaming incorrect data.

2010-05-12  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o reintegrate merge changes

2010-05-12  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o moved function to AggregationUtil for refactor.

	Bug fixes for #1514.  Name collisions were being checked only for new attributes or variables, not both.  The namespaces are actually the same, so we need to make sure the FQN is entirely free when making new attributes and variables.

2010-04-02  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Dropped autoconf min version to 2.62 (which the top-level shrew configure.ac requires) instead of 2.63 now that icu is not a subproject that requires it.

	Added a couple of examples for joinNew on grids to the installed data.

2010-02-05  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Newer gcc doesn't allow inner classes to be private.  VariableValueValidator defn made public.

2010-02-04  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Test added for autogenerated explicit coordinate variable for joinNew map.  Uses values@start and values@increment to make an explicit map of the correct dimensionality.

2010-02-04  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Fixes for Ticket #1445.  We now allow placeholder (no values set) new variables to exist until the closing of their enclosing dataset (netcdf element).  This allows the author to specify the new coordinate variable (map vector) metadata but allow the joinNew aggregation to set the values in the closing phase of the netcdf element.  If the values are not set after the aggregation postprocessing step, a parse error is thrown to avoid later libdap internal errors (and it's also illegal ncml to make a new variable with no values).

2010-02-04  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Removing many autogenerated files that were accidentally added at initial recursive add.

2010-01-30  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Changes to attempt to fix nightly build error ticket #1473.

	icu/source/icudefs.mk.in: changed to add "hyrax_icu" to prefix var.  This file is used by the entire icu build so it all gets installed into ${prefix}/hyrax_icu regardless of whether prefix is set with --prefix or is defaults.

	icu/source/configure.gnu: changed to ignore certain top-level configure options and add hyrax-specific options to the call to the actual configure.  Removed prefix changes since they failed with default prefix.  Solved in icudefs.mk.in.

2010-01-29  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Ticket #1472.  Support for sorting on the coordValue ISO 8601 date if a scan@dateFormatMark is used.

	o Removed the test for matching the prefix of the dateFormatMark exactly.  Instead, we just skip that many characters, as the NcML aggregation page says.  Was necessary to make our new test work.

	o Changed the regexp for the dateFormatMark tests since both datasets live in the same dir and the only expressions were overmatching.

2010-01-29  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Removing accidental cache dir inclusion.

2010-01-29  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Doc change for #1473 to list changes we make to configure.in original.

2010-01-29  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Attempt to fix configure failure portion of #1473 .  This is a known ICU 4.2.1 bug with newer automakes and will be in the next stable release.  For now I use there suggestion to workaround the problem in the stable release by changing configure.in

2010-01-28  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Added scan@dateFormatMark support and tests for #1444.

	o This required adding a modified redistribution of the ICU project for handling SimpleDateFormat and formatting ISO 8601 dates.   It is built as part of the modules build process and designed to not interfere with other installations of ICU that may already exist.  We link the static libraries directly into the module shared lib to avoid dependency issues.

2010-01-28  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o New baseline for test 426 failing.  XML entity change resulted in changing baseline.

2010-01-25  hyoklee

	Corrected typo in URL.

2010-01-12  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	No longer using the script to modify bes.conf. Instead, now using
	standalone configuration file.
	D    bes-ncml-data.sh.in
	A    ncml.conf.in
	M    Makefile.am

2010-01-10  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	API change to BESKeys. Changed modules included in bes.conf to use
	xml_command module instead of string command module.
	M    DirectoryUtil.cc
	M    tests/bes.conf.in

2010-01-08  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	--clean to clean build and src files for rpmbuild
	M    Makefile.am

2009-12-29  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Shrew build changes that will hopefully lead to a version that we can build using NMI's B&T system. Also, I added 'cccc' targets so that we can take a 'metrics snapshot' without undue pain.

2009-12-28  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Added scan@olderThan functionality for filtering based on file modification times.

2009-12-18  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Added scan@regExp attribute support for specifying aggregation scans with a regular expression.  Part of #1444

2009-12-17  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Initial implementation of scanning dirs for aggregations (#1444).  Handles suffix, subdirs recursion only at the moment.

2009-12-02  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	For ticket #1450.  Added AttrTableLazyPtr to NCMLParser so that we only load the DDX for the root dataset (since it's required to actually load the metadata).  Any child dataset, i.e. aggregation member, will not have its DDX loaded by default any more, only those that show up in the hyperslab.

2009-12-01  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Need include of <typinfo> for use of typeid in ISO C++.

2009-12-01  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Attempt to fix broken ISO C++ issue with circular objects.

2009-11-30  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Initial checkpoint of Grid joinNew aggregation for #1419 and #1446.  Still several outstanding issues in other tickets.

2009-11-24  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Fixes to allow compilation with FILE_METHODS macro and other changes to libdap interfaces

2009-11-09  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Adding new files

2009-11-09  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Adding new files

2009-10-21  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Changed to SAX2 interface with namespace support, many required interface changes.  Allows OtherXML attribute to get a snapshot of any ancestral namespaces in its lexical scope before it's serialized so it remains namespace-valid and complete.

2009-10-09  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Added tests for joinNew on HDF5 data.  Added HDF5 to make check install reqs and the besstandalone bes.conf.

2009-10-09  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Changes to support NCML file line numbers in Parse Error exceptions. (Ticket #1432).

	Changed autotest match from fgrep to grep to allow regexp matching rather than exact strings.

2009-10-07  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Test case for #1433.  Won't repro, expected fixed by fixes for #1416 in previous changeset.

2009-10-07  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Fixed bugs with having a dot ('.') in an attribute name or a variable name causing a recursive search.  Dot is now a valid character for a variable or attribute name and it is no longer used as a DAP FQN field separator in an NCML context.  For Ticket #1416

2009-10-06  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Added support for attributes of the new libdap attribute type "OtherXML" for ticket #1424 since WCS needs this.  The contained XML is checked for well-formedness, but otherwise is just copied verbatim, along with all whitespace.

2009-10-05  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	AggregationUtil.cc, AggregationElement.cc: Initial implementation of joinNew on Array for data response (dods) along with virtual dataset and Netcdf data tests.

	Shape.cc, NCMLBaseArray.h, NCMLArray.h:  Bug fixes in data caching code.

	Updated module version and libdap required version.

2009-10-01  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Problem with tests in production versus debug build.  Removed.

2009-09-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	It just seem right to save things at this point. Most of the configure.ac files have been updated. The libdap software has had a number of the FILE* methods/functions commented out using #if FILE_METHODS and then #undef FILE_METHODS. We'll see how much of the redundant code can be removed before the next Hyrax 1.6 release.

2009-09-22  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Test case (DAS,DDX,DDS only) for multiple aggregation vars in joinNew.

2009-09-22  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	DDX, DAS, DDS responses for joinNew.

2009-09-16  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Fixed segfault and other bugs with using empty string for attribute and variable values.  (ticket #1413)

2009-09-14  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Fixed using attribute@separator on string arrays for ticket #1411.  Now if unspecified separator, whitespace is the default for all types EXCEPT string.  An attribute of type string will NOT be tokenized into an array if separator isn't specified, but only if it IS specified.  All other data types are tokenized with a whitespace separator.  (the annotated ncml2.2 schema specifies this).

2009-09-11  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Fixed attribute of type string not properly tokenizing arrays of strings with a separator specified (ticket #1411)

	Added whitespace trimming from attribute values of numeric or URL type, but string maintains lead and trailing spaces. (ticket #1411)

2009-09-11  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Changes describing problem with NetCDF Grid and DAS response.

2009-09-11  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Disallowed assignment operator= in RCObject, NCMLElement, and all subclasses to avoid bugs.  We don't need it for now.

	RCObject.{h,cc}: Added copy ctor implementation that adds the copy to the prototype's pool if it exists.

	New tests for Grid bug in ticket #1405.

2009-09-09  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Added VariableAggElement needed for joinNew and support in AggregationElement for it.

	o Refactored NCMLElement to contain a back ptr to NCMLParser since many subclasses needed it.

2009-09-09  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Added attribute validation checks to parse error on unknown attributes specified in all NCMLElement concrete subclasses rather than silently or mysteriously fail later.  See Ticket #1385.

2009-09-08  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	point check in to move it to new dir

2009-09-04  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Made NCMLElement::Factory an instance member of NCMLParser rather than a singleton and added a basic memory pool that cleans up any dangling memory leaks from unref'd memory.

2009-09-04  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	ValuesElement.{h,cc}, VariableElement.{h,cc}: Bug fixes for not specifying values in new variable or specifying values more than once for new variable.  Ticket #1394

2009-09-03  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	AggregationUtil.{cc,h}: Change of namespace to agg_util to help clarify encapsulation of aggregation functions

	RCObject.{h,cc}: Made red() and unref() const and the count mutable to allow ref on const objects.

	AggregationElement.{h,cc}, NetcdfElement.{h,cc}, DimensionElement.{h,cc}: Added support for union on dimension for pure virtual datasets.

	More tests for union.

2009-09-03  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	bes.conf.in: changed the name of the cmd module to the new name

2009-09-03  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Changed the bes.conf target to use the previously set BES_MODULE_DIR rather than run bes-config.

2009-09-02  Nathan Potter <ndp@coas.oregonstate.edu>

2009-09-02  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	o Fixed build errors in includes

	o Checkpointing impl of aggregation.

	o Added AggregationElement for parsing aggregations.

	o Refactored NetcdfElement to contain an aggregation element.

	o Refactored parser to handle more than one netcdf element.

	o Added RCObject and RCPtr<T> for reference coutned smart pointers for NCMLElement's to be kept around after the SAX parser pops them off the stack.

	o Added initial code for union aggregation in AggregationUtil.

	o Refactored DimensionElement to use new Dimension

	o Introduced agg_util namespace to encapsulate the aggregation code into its own lib eventually.

	o Initial tests for union aggregation.  We union attributes and variables, but dimensions are not yet implemented.

2009-09-02  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>
