/** @brief Container representing a NCML request
 *
 * The real name of a NCMLContainer is the actual NCML request. When the
 * access method is called the NCML request is made, the response cached if
 * Successful, and the target response returned as the real container that
 * a data handler would then open.
 *
 * @note This code is broken - but it was never actually used. The code closes
 * the open stream that is returned using a value-result parameter in NCMLContainer::access
 * but it should not be doing that. Instead is should keep the stream as a field and
 * close it in the dtor. jhrg 8/12/15
