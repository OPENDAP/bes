            <Message>fileout_netcdf: The datatype of this variable 'ui32_array' is not supported. It is very possible that you try to obtain a netCDF file that follows the netCDF classic model. The unsigned 32-bit integer and signed/unsigned 64-bit integer are not supported by the netCDF classic model. Downloading this file as the netCDF-4 file that follows the netCDF enhanced model should solve the problem.</Message>
