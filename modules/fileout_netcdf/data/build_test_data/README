This directory holds programs that build .dods files that are 
used along with the dapreader handler to test the fileout_netcdf 
handler's operation. The programs were copied from the original
'unit-tests' directory (which may have been removed by now...)
and modified to just make .dods files that the dapreader handler
can process.

Over time the tests in 'unit-tests' got stale because they never
tested the netcdf4 output and used a cloned version of the fileout_netcdf
handler's main 'transform()' function - they were not actually testing
the handler. As the handler was modified more and more, the cloned
transform() and the handler's code diverged. The tests in 'tests'
use the handler itself.

To build .dods & .das files for use with dapreader when the original
files are readable by hyrax, use besstandalone like this:

    besstandalone -c bes.conf i <bescmd input>
    
Note that you will probably have to hack the bes.conf.in or 
bes.conf.modules.in by hand, write your own bescmd file. It's not hard.

Be on the lookout for odd errors with the .das responses. If the .das
is generated with MIME headers there will be a very strange error message
coming from inside dapreader about illegal chars in the XML. The error
looks like it is coming from besstandalone, making things very odd seeming. 

Some of the programs are here but are not used:

attrT is redundant (fnoc1 and other tests have attributes) and has
broken output for an unknown reason - something in the BESDapResponseBuilder
code that writes the DAS.

seqT seems pointless since this handler just ignores sequences

readT does what dapreader does, but as an executable

The programs are built automatically, but they have to be run 
by hand - the data files are stored in the data directory.
