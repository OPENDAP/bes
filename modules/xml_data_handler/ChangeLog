	Merge pull request #59 from OPENDAP/cache_fix
	Cache fix

	Clean up residual cache code. Add a note about fcntl(2) versus flock(2)
	Both fcntl(2) and flock(2) can be used for advisory locking. The
	BESFileLockingCache uses fcntl() and that impacts testing since
	all of our testing is single-process. Not a huge deal, but if we
	want more complete testing we'll need to change how we implement
	the locks or use multi-process testing.

	Modest fixes to the test code in cacheT

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/cacheT_fix' into cache_fix

	This code now builds and passes the tests we have...
	But we might ned or want to write more/better tests for the cache.

2017-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix to BESFSDir for the opendir/readdir race condition.
	When two processes are using the same directory and one process makes
	and deletes files in the directory at the same time as the other
	process uses opendir/readdir to iterate over the files in the
	directory, it's possible for file names to show up in entries returned
	by readdir that no longer exist (i.e., stat(2) returns -1). It's better
	to ignore this than signal an error (IMHO).

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:/opendap/bes

	Removed errant tab in Makefile.am

	Fixed an error in both scale_util.cc and its test code (ScaleUtilTest.cc)
	In scale_util.cc:get_gcp_data() the code samples the data and uses
	both integer division and 'increment by sample factor' and those
	were producing an off by one error in some cases.

	Removed ScaleUtilTest from bes/functions for now.

	Fixed BesDebug --> BESDebug and removed some generated files.

	Ugh. Still recovering from geo-functions merge mess - removed generatged files
	... From gateway bes-testsuite

	Added bes-testsuite for w10n handler

	Added the bes-testsuite dir back in for the gateway handler

2017-03-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed all the unused lines from the pvolT BES keys file

	Patched the pvolT test so that it writes temp files to ./cache
	This keeps those temp files from conflicting with the BESKeys use of
	a regex in the BES.Include line in one of it's test files. This is not
	a real fix for the problem, which will take a bit more time - and an
	understanding of the BES File and Dir classes...

	Fixed the various badness of my previous merge of geo-functions.

	OK. Added the gateway and w10n handlers back in.

2017-03-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added comment to ContainerStorageVolatile about needing BESKeys file

	pvolT now uses separate tests.
	I'm not sure this really addresses the underlying issue with the pvolT
	and keysT conflict, but is makes the test cleaner and might help debug
	the issue.

	Added options to unit-tests keysT and pvolT

2017-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Unit tests in dispatch fail when run in parallel. This is a fix.
	The setup() code in pvolT seems to conflict with the code in keysT
	when keysT starts and then pvolT starts and finishes before keysT
	finishes. I have no idea why, but the text in the pvolT's setup()
	shows up in keysT. It turns out that the setup() code is not needed,
	and removing it seems to fix the problem. Seems to...

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of
	changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and
	BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression
	cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache
	configuration collisions with various handlers that also were
	utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by
	calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir,
	BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we
	specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from
	the other caches.

	Fixes for issues found by Coverity

2015-09-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified Makefile.am to support distcheck

2015-09-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/xml_data_handler

	Removed hdf5 handler from tests bes.conf
	It is not used; when it does not get built, the tests fail
	even though it is not actually needed.

2015-08-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed package.m4 in the autoconf dirs Makefile.am files

2015-04-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/xml_data_handler

	Modified Makefile.am to support bes distcheck

2015-04-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Version 1.0.6
2015-03-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Accommodate autoconf 2.63
	Changed the AT_ARG_OPTION_ARG macro so that it uses _ instead of - for
	the word separator in multi-word options.

2015-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for	distclean and the modules build.

2015-01-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed dist-hook which as a hack for SVN

2014-12-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed configure.ac, Makefile.am and bes.conf.in after merging with 'modules'

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/modules'

2014-12-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added module name and version info to Makefile.am
	This change was made to support the modules build where the autoconf
	symbols PACKAGE_NAME and _MODULE are defined by the bes configure
	script. This meant that the version response from the bes was useless
	since it listed every module as 'bes' and gave the bes' version
	number.

2014-12-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updates for the hyrax-1.10 release
	I updated the spec file dependencies and removed the OSX_Resources
	dir from the EXTRA_DIST Makefile variable since that dir is empty
	and git does not make empty dirs. If/When we start supporting those
	builds again, we can revisit this decision.

2014-12-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the modules branch bes.conf file.
	The bes.conf file used with the bes modules branch now uses
	the hdf 4 and 5 handlers, so all of the tests work.

2014-11-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed hdf4 and hdf5 from the bes.conf build with from the bes modules branch build until those are working. Added the handler's conf file to gitignore.

2014-11-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes for the modules build.
	Modified the Makefile.am files, configure.ac and tweaked the
	bes tests so that they use a bes.conf file built using either the
	local configure (standard build) or the bes configure (modules
	build).

2014-10-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the unit tests.
	M    unit-tests/Makefile.am

2014-09-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed the old OPENDAP_DEBUG_OPTIONS macro from many configure.ac files. Fixed some param initializations; method overloads (virtual methods that lacked 'const'). Other warnings.

	rationalized the XMLWriter.h includes give its move into libdap.

2011-12-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for the distcheck target. Variables like $abs_top_srcdir
	work fine for 'check' but not for 'distcheck' because with
	distcheck they have a '../' in them and when a path like that is
	passed to the BES, it reports an error. The way around this is to
	use readlink -f on the value of that variable and substitute the
	result. One wrinkle on this is that OSX lacks a working version of
	readlink. See configure.ac for the work-around.

2011-11-23  Nathan Potter <ndp@coas.oregonstate.edu>

	xml_data_handler: Fixed type in spec file

2011-11-22  Nathan Potter <ndp@coas.oregonstate.edu>

2011-10-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	the library by default. Changed the copyrights so they are
	correct. Fixed tests.

2011-10-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2010-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed lingering issues with xmlWriter API. Two problems: In some cases, start_xml_element() was called with element == "" and the xmlWriter function will not create an element like that! Odd that xmlGetLastError() did not return an error object... Second issue: One call to xmlWriterStartElement did not include the test < 0 so if the function returned 0 it was treated as an error. Oddly, it seems that the function often was returning a positive value often, so this condition didn't trigger an exception until several calls into making the document.
