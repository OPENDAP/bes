Updated for version 1.0.5

The XML data handler is based on the asciival handler included in the
dap-server package. This handler builds a response that returns data
values as ASCII in a XML document. Of course, for most data doing this
for an entire dataset is sheer insanity but, properly constrained, the
results are very useful for software that needs to find out about
specific data values such as those at the extrema of arrays. This
handler is primarily intented to be used in those situations, with
constraint expressions that limit the size of the data response to
only a few values, in conjunction with semantic-web software.
