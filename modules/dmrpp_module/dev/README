0. The example/utility code that shows how to retrieve the string datasets and how to obtain the VL string dataset's offset and length.
1. String data files for different storage and the code files that generate these files can be found under data_generation/.
2. read_str_vars.cc reads the either fixed-size or variable length string datasets under the root group.
3. h5_obj_addr_info.c outputs the dataset's offset and length for different storages.
4. obtain_vlstr_addr.cc is the routine that obtains the variable length string dataset's offset and length by decoding the global heap.
5. test_read_vl_offset.cc is a simple program to check the real VL string data via the offset and length generated by obtain_vlstr_addr.cc.
6. obtain_vlstr_addr_hard_code_subset.cc is unfinished but still tested a bit to generate a subset of VL string data.
7. Directory for_debugging includes some code files are for debugging purpose.
