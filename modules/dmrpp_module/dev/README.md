# HDF5  Arrays of String
Here you can find:
* The example/utility code that shows how to retrieve the string datasets and how to obtain the 
VL string dataset's offset and length.
* String data files for different storage and the code files that generate these files can be 
found under _data_generation_ subdirectory.
* The subdirectory _for_debugging_ includes some source code files that are for debugging purposes.


Code Samples:
1. **`read_str_vars.cc`** reads the either fixed-size or variable length string datasets under the root group.
1. **`h5_obj_addr_info.c`** outputs the dataset's offset and length for different storages.
1. **`obtain_vlstr_addr.cc`** is the routine that obtains the variable length string dataset's offset and length by decoding the global heap.
1. **`test_read_vl_offset.cc`** is a simple program to check the real VL string data via the offset and length generated by obtain_vlstr_addr.cc.
1. **`obtain_vlstr_addr_hard_code_subset.cc`** is unfinished but still tested a bit to generate a subset of VL string data.
