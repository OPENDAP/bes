This module ingests special DMR files that contain range, offset and structural
information about the associated HDF5 files. This information allows the 
server to use "range GETs" against the datasets, either in the file system or 
over the network, such that the HDF libraries are not needed to retrieve the values.

This handler does not currently support the following types:
Structure
Sequence
Group
Opaque
Str
Url

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#
# DMR++ module specific parameters
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

# These are the default values
#
# Set UseParallelTransfers to no or false to use serial transfers of data

# DMRPP.UseParallelTransfers=yes

# Set maxParallelTransfers to N where N is the number of parallel data
# transfers at any given time. These will be run using the libcurl 'multi'
# API which uses a round-robin scheme. Eight is the default; more often
# reduces throughput

# DMRPP.MaxParallelTransfers=8
