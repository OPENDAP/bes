ERROR: Your have asked this service to utilize the DAP2 data model
to process your request. Unfortunately the requested dataset contains
data types that cannot be represented in DAP2.
 
There are 4 incompatible variables and/or attributes referenced 
in your request.
Incompatible variables: 

    Int8 tep_valid_spot[6]
    Int8 tep_valid_spot@flag_values
    Int8 tep_valid_spot@valid_max
    Int8 tep_valid_spot@valid_min

You may resolve these issues by asking the service to use
the DAP4 data model instead of the DAP2 model.

 - NetCDF If you wish to receive your response encoded as a
   netcdf file please note that netcdf-3 has similar representational
   constraints as DAP2, while netcdf-4 does not. In order to request
   a DAP4 model nectdf-4 response, change your request URL from 
   dataset_url.nc to dataset_url.dap.nc4

 - DAP Clients If you are using a specific DAP client like pyDAP or
   Panoply you may be able to signal the tool to use DAP4 by changing
   the protocol of the dataset_url from https:// to dap4:// 

 - If you are using the service's Data Request Form for your dataset
   you can find the DAP4 version by changing form_url.html to form_url.dmr.html
