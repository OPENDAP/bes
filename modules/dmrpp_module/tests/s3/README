The *_local.dap bes command files reference a local copy of an AIRS
granule that I edited to reduce its size. I used h5copy to copy about 10
variables from a 300MB AIRS granule to the 4MB AIRS_partial.h5 file.

The non-local tests reference the real AIRS granule 
(AIRS.2015.12.30.L3.RetStd_IR001.v6.0.31.0.G16116184203.nc.h5) that is 
in our/Raytheon's S3 account. There is a copy of AIRS_partial.h5 there
as well. I have not switched the non-local tests to use it, however.

One issues is that while the values are the same for the variable that
are common to both files, other things about the files are different.
Chunk sizes, however, are the same as are the names and types for each
of the copied variables.
