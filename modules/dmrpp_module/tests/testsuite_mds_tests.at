dnl The four dim files make output so large that the print representation of the
dnl values does not work on linux - it switches to scientific notation at some
dnl point. Constrain these accesses to limit the size. I have verified that the
dnl data access does work. jhrg 4/27/18

dnl This test is a good idea, but the float representations are not reliable
