  This file contains a few notes about the HDF4 File Content Map Writer
 (h4mapwriter).

  h4mapwriter is a utility that creates an HDF4 file content map for a given 
HDF4 file. An HDF4 file content map is an XML document that describes the file
 structure, file metadata, and offset/length of raw data in an HDF4 file. The 
map can be used to retrieve data from an HDF4 file without relying on the HDF4 
library.


Header files
    hmap.h     -- the header file that combines all other header files.
    h4.h       -- the header file for reading data info.
    xml.h      -- the header file for writing XML elements. 
    xml_sds.h  -- the header file for writing XML elements for SDS objects.
    xml_vg.h   -- the header file for writing XML elements for Vgroup objects.


Source files
    hmap.c       -- the main program for h4mapwriter.
    h4.c         -- the functions that check unmappable objects.
    h4_pal.c     -- the functions that read mapping information for Palettes.
    h4_ris.c     -- the functions that read mapping information for Rasters.
    h4_sds.c     -- the functions that read mapping information for SDS.
    h4_vdata.c   -- the functions that read mapping information for Vdata.
    xml_an.c     -- the functions that write information for Annotation.
    xml_hmap.c   -- the common utility functions for writing map.
    xml_pal.c    -- the functions that write information for Palettes.
    xml_ris.c    -- the functions that write information for Rasters.
    xml_sds.c    -- the functions that write information for SDS.
    xml_vdata.c  -- the functions that write information for Vdata.
    xml_vg.c     -- the functions that write information for Vgroup.

Build Instruction
  To compile the source codes, you will need to install the HDF4 library.
  Change CC path in Makefile so that it can point to h4cc (e.g., 
  CC=/usr/local/hdf4/bin/h4cc).

  See the file INSTALL for full installation instructions.

Usage
   %h4mapwriter
   %h4mapwriter -h[elp] for help, OR
   %h4mapwriter [-cefmntV] [-i TAG-LIST] [-s md5] [-z[1-9]] [-lLOG] HDF4 [XML]]

  For example, run "h4mapwriter test.hdf test.hdf.map.xml"
  See also man(1) page of h4mapwriter after installation.

Limitations
    o For compressed SDS datasets, it handles gzip compression only.
    o It cannot handle Vdata with column storage order.
    o It cannot handle little-endian data types.
    o It cannot handle dataset that uses external file.
    o It cannot handle raster images other than 8-bit with RLE compression.
    o It cannot handle object annotations other than GR / SDS / Palette 
      object annotation.
    o It cannot handle some NASA OCTS Level 3 product that involves palettes.
