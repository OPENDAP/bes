README

These files are used for the tests that exercise the DMR++ modifications
in the BES framework in the bes/dap/BESDap4ResponseHandler and BESDataResponseHandler.
Those classes test the MDS for DMR++ responses for a given data file and
redirect the data response so that it will use the DMR++ RequestHandler and
not the RequestHandler that matches the actual data file (as given by the
TypeMatch regular expression).

NB: Set the URL used for the DMR++ responses so that href is the value
"file://@abs_top_srcdir@/modules/dmrpp_module/data/dmrpp/chunked_fourD.h5".
Note also that the file must be renamed to end in '.in' so that the Makefile
in dmrpp_module/tests can edit it.
