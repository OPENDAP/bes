README

These files are used for the tests that exercise the DMR++ modifications
in the BES framework in the bes/dap/BESDap4ResponseHandler and BESDataResponseHandler.
Those classes test the MDS for DMR++ responses for a given data file and
redirect the data response so that it will use the DMR++ RequestHandler and
not the RequestHandler that matches the actual data file (as given by the
TypeMatch regular expression).

NB: If new data are added to this (to expand the tests, e.g.), copy it to
modules/dmrpp_module/tests so that it will be used.
