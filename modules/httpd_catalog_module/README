HTTP Catalog module.

Notes:

1) The initial token in the path that triggers this module is set in the 
HttpdMCatalogModule.cc file at the call

    BESCatalogList::TheCatalogList()->add_catalog(new HttpdCatalog(HTTPD_CATALOG_NAME));
        
where HTTPD_CATALOG_NAME is "RemoteResources"

2) While the default catalog is lenient WRT trailing slashes on pathnames,
code (and thus the /RemoteResources catalog) is not. This is because there
is no way for the code to know whether a given path is a 'node' or a 'leaf'
until it makes a call. Use information from the <showNode> command for the
parent to determine if a given path is a node or leaf and append a / as needed.

Note that the 'RemoteResourse catalog can have many remote 'collections,'
each of which has a name bound to a HTTP/S URL:

    Httpd_Catalog.Collections = test:http://test.opendap.org/data/
    
To access this collection, use /RemoteResources/test/ in the path.

For this to properly build DAP responses, the returned item needs to be recognized
by the default catalog's TypeMatch parameter. For example, to work with HDF5 data
named *.h5, the value 'h5:.*\.h5$' should be part of the TypeMatch parameter. This
is odd because the type of the container is determined using the MIME type of the
response from the remote resource.
