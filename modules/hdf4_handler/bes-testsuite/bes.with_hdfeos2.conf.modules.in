#direc HDF4 to DMR key
H4.EnableDirectDMR=true

# EnableCF: Handle HDF data to follow the CF conventions
#          (true,yes|false,no, defaults to true)
# Since most centers  would like to handle HDF4 data that follows CF now,
# EnableCF is set to be true, KY 2012-6-5
#
#   If this key's value is false, the handler will behave same as the default 
#  handler. The output will not follow basic CF conventions and most of NASA 
# products cannot be visualized by netCDF visualization tools such as IDV and 
# Panoply. The rest of keys below relies on this option and it must be set
# to be "true" to have effects on the handler's output. Thus, this is the most 
# important key to turn it on first.
H4.EnableCF=true

H4.EnablePassFileID=true


# When turning on this key, the handler will handle AIRS level 3 version 6 products
# and MOD08_M3-like products in a speedy way by taking advantage of the special data
# structures in these two products. Using this key requires the use of HDF-EOS2 lib.
# now although HDF-EOS2 lib. will not be called. By turning on this key, potentially
# HDF-EOS2 files that provide dimension scales for all dimensions may also be handled
# quickly. By default, this key should be set to true.
H4.EnableSpecialEOS=true

# DisableScaleOffsetComp: Disable Scale and offset computation  
#
# Some NASA HDF4(MODIS etc.) products don't follow the CF rule to pack the data.
# To avoid the confusion for OPeNDAP's clients , the handler may adopt the following two approaches:

# 1) Apply the scale and offset computation to the individual data point if the scale 
#    and offset rule doesn't follow CF in the handler.
#
# 2) If possible, transform the scale and offset rule to CF rule.
#
# Since approach 1 may degrade the performance of fetching large size data by heavy computation,
# we recommend approach 2, which is indicated by setting this key to be true.   
# By default, this key should always be true.  
H4.DisableScaleOffsetComp=true

# By turning on this key, the handler will check if the datatype of scale_factor and offset is the same.
# This is required by CF.
# if they don't share the same datatype, the handler will make the data type of offset be the same as that of scale_factor.
#Since we haven't found the data type inconsistencies of scale_factor and offset, in order not affect the 
# performance, this key will be set to false by default. 
H4.EnableCheckScaleOffsetType = false

# Disable StructMetadata 
H4.DisableStructMetaAttr=true

# This key is for MODIS swath that uses the dimension map.
# If this key is set to be true, the handler will search the directory where the data files reside and see
# if corresponding MODIS geolocation files(MOD03 or MYD03) can be found, if yes, the handler will use 
# the corresponding MODIS geolocation files for latitude and longitude.
H4.EnableCheckMODISGeoFile=false

#   If this key's value is false, additional Vdata such as "Level 1B Swath 
#  Metadta" in LAADS MYD021KM product will not be processed and visible 
#  in the DAS/DDS output. Those additional Vdatas are added directly using 
#  HDF4 APIs and HDF-EOS2 APIs cannot access them.
H4.EnableHybridVdata=true

# Some CERES products(CER_AVG,CER_ES4,CER_SRB and CER_ZAVG, see description
# in the HDFSP.h) have  many SDS fields and some Vdata fields. Correspondingly,
# the DDS and DAS page may be very long. The performance of accessing such
# products with visualization clients may be greatly affected. 
# It may potentially  even choke netCDF java clients.
# To avoid such cases, we will not map vdata to DAP in such products by default.
# Users can turn on this key to check vdata information of some CERES products.
# This key will not affect the access of other products.
H4.EnableCERESVdata=false

#   If this key's value is false, small Vdata datasets will be mapped to 
# arrays in DDS output instead of attributes in DAS. 
#   If this key's value is true, Vdata is mapped to attribute if there are less than 
# or equal to 10 records.
H4.EnableVdata_to_Attr=true

#   If this key's value is false, the short dataset name becomes long name with
# Vgroup prefixed and fullpath attribute will not be printed in DAS output.
#   For example, the DAS output for Region_Number dataset
#
#      Region_Number {
#          String coordinates "Colatitude Longitude";
#          String fullpath "/Monthly Hourly Averages/Time And Position/Region Nu\
# mber";
#     }
#
# becomes
#    
#     Monthly_Hourly_Averages_Time_And_Position_Region_Number {
#          String coordinates "Monthly_Hourly_Averages_Time_And_Position_Colatit\
# ude Monthly_Hourly_Averages_Time_And_Position_Longitude";
#     }
#
# in CER_AVG_Aqua-FM3-MODIS_Edition2B_007005.200510.hdf.
H4.EnableCERESMERRAShortName=true

#   If this key's value is false, handler will check if there's any Vdata that 
#  has the same name as SDS. We haven't found such case in NASA products so it's 
# safe to disable this to improve performance.
H4.DisableVdataNameclashingCheck=true

#   If this key's value is true, handler will generate Vdata's attributes. By 
#     default, it's turned off because most NASA hybrid products do not seem to store
#  important information in Vdata attributes. If you serve pure HDF4 files, it's 
#     recommended to turn this value to true so that users can see all data. This
#  key will not affect the behavior of the handler triggered by the 
#     H4.EnableVdata_to_Attr key in section 3.3 except the Vdata attributes of
#  small Vdatas that are mapped to DAS instead of DDS. They will be also turned
#     off from the DAS output.
#  If Vdata doesn't have any attribute or field attribute, the description

#         String hdf4_vd_desc "This is an HDF4 Vdata.";

#  will not appear in the attribute for that Vdata although the key is true.
#     The attribute container of the Vdata will always appear regardless of this key.
