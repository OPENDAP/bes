Currently there are a few tests that the normal "make check" doesn't cover. Depending on one's need, they can be easily tested manually. Eventually if it is necessary, a kind of automatic tests should be implemented.

1. HDF-EOS2 configuration option with NASA data
1) Obtain the NASA HDF4 data
cd ../data.nasa
./download.sh
cd ../data
ln -s ../data.nasa . 
cd ..
2) make check
All tests should get passed.

2. Valgrind tests

mv hdf4_handlerTest.with_hdfeos2.at hdf4_handlerTest.with_hdfeos2.at.orig
1) fake data test
(1) cp hdf4_handlerTest.with_hdfeos2.valgrind.at hdf4_handlerTest.with_hdfeos2.at
(2) cd ..
(3) make check
(4) pushd /tmp
(5) grep "definitely lost: " h4.valgrind.log
You should only see ""definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks"

2) NASA data test
(1) Make sure to obtain the NASA HDF4 data stated in section 1. 
(2) cp hdf4_handlerTest.nasa.with_hdfeos2.valgrind.at hdf4_handlerTest.with_hdfeos2.at
(2) cd ..
(3) make check
(4) pushd /tmp
(5) grep "definitely lost: " h4.nasa.valgrind.log
You should only see ""definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks"


3. HDF4 only configuration option 
For this test, the handler is configured by using the HDF4 library only.
1) make distclean
2) configure the HDF4 handler with the HDF4 library only option.
3) make 
4) make check  
All tests should get passed.

At the end of all the tests,
cd bes-testsuite
mv hdf5_handlerTest.with_hdfeos2.at.orig hdf5_handlerTest.with_hdfeos2.at
