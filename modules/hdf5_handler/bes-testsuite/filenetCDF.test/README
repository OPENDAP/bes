Includes are shell scripts that 
1) can test filenetCDF-3 and filenetCDF-4 modules. 
2) can test Unidata's nccopy access.
For filenetCDF-3 and filenetCDF-4 tests, one needs to install BES. The BES path is needed.
For nccopy tests, one needs to install Hyrax server(both BES and OLFS). One needs to change the server URL in the scripts.
To check filenetCDF-3 and filenetCDF-4 tests, for default tests, on all platforms,  Run
./test.sh  
For selective NASA file tests, on Linux Run:
./test-nasa.sh
on Mac Run
./test-nasa-mac.sh
You should see "All tests get passed."

For nccopy tests, go to nc_copy_test and run corresponding shell scripts.
