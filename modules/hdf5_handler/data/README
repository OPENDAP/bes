t_fillvalue_2d_2x2y.nc4.h5 and t_scale_2d_2x2y.nc4.h5 are not 1-D lat/lon 
nc4 files. Thus, we cannot assure that they can be displayed by clients. 
However, up to this point, we are sure that we handle them to follow the 
dimensional scale model. In the future, the handlings may be enhanced and 
the results may be different.
