  This supplementary document is mainly about how one can use another Hyrax module
NcML handler to work with the HDF5 handler to serve NASA HDF5/netCDF-4/HDF-EOS5 products.
For comprehensive information about the HDF5 handler, check [1] and [2].

  Although the HDF5 handler tries to make attributes follow the CF conventions 
 automatically, to reduce the long-term maintenance effort, the handler may not
 check or correct all attributes. For example,the units of variable time (Time)
 may not follow CF conventions.  

  For example, CF expects the units of time is something like "minutes since
2002-12-01 00:00:00". The units for variable time in the HDF5 file may be "s".
 
  To correct the attribute value, one can use OPeNDAP's NcML handler. With this
 module, a data provider can augment datasets served on their local Hyrax 
server in the following ways:

  o Add, modify, or remove both attributes and variables
  o Combine multiple datasets into a single "virtual" data set using "union", 
  "joinNew", or "joinExisting" aggregations.

 Writing an NcML file is as easy as writing an HTML file. Please refer to 
 the NcML example page [3] and [4] at the HDF-EOS Tools and Information Center website.
