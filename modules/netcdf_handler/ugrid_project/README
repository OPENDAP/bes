What is here:

This directory contains the software to test the gridfields
server-function, ugrid_restrict(). Because the function requires
changes to the normal netcdf_handler build (although minor), that
build is also described here.

* Building the handler and the ugrid_restrict() function

Assumption: You are working on Linux and have the netcdf 4 library
installed. On red hat systems, you can do this with yum; on debian
systems apt-get will work.

** Build the development version of Hyrax

1. Checkout the Hyrax source code from OPeNDAP's subversion repository

   svn co https://scm.opendap.org/svn/trunk/shrew

In the directory created, set up some basic build paths for the shell
(Assumption: You are using bash)

    source spath.sh

That will set $PATH and a second environment variable named $prefix;
the latter references the root directory that holds all the software
that was just checked out using subversion. In the rest of this file,
'$prefix' will be used to refer to that directory.

2. Modify the build the development version of Hyrax. A full build of
Hyrax can involve a fair amount of software that's completely
extraneous to the ugrid_restrict() function, but with some minor edits
to the build files, the build can be tailored so just the parts useful
in testing the ugrid_restrict() function are built. First, edit
$prefix/src/modules/Makefile.am so that the variable 'SUBDIRS'
contains only the three modules shown below:

    SUBDIRS = dap-server netcdf_handler fileout_netcdf

Also edit the file $prefix/src/modules/configure.ac so that the
AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS() macro contains the same three modules:

    AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([dap-server netcdf_handler fileout_netcdf])

3. Build the limited version of Hyrax:

cd $prefix
autoreconf --force --install --verbose
./configure --prefix=$prefix --enable-debug
make world

This will build the entire code base (but note that the Makefile.am
and configure.ac files in src/modules have been edited for this
particular installation to build only a subset of the handlers). 

4. Get and build the gridfields library code

    svn co https://gridfields.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/clib gridfields_clib

To build the code and install it in /usr/local/

autoreconf --force --install --verbose
./configure
make
make check
make install

If you want to put it some place else, use 
   ./configure --prefix=<some place else>
but then remember to tweak the build of the netcdf_handler (coming up)
so that it knows where to find gridfields using --with-gridfields=...

5. Rebuild the netcdf_handler of Hyrax so that the ugrid_restrict()
function is defined. Go to $prefix/src/modules/netcdf_handler and run
./configure again by hand like this:

    ./configure --prefix=$prefix --with-gridfields=/usr/local
    
assuming that gridfields has been built and installed in /usr/local.

Then

    make
    make check
    make install

* Testing the ugrid function

There are two ways to do test the ugrid_restrict() function, both of
which use the *.bes command files in this directory. The first way
starts the BES and uses a command line client tool to run the
commands. The second way uses the 'besstandalone' tool, which is a
test harness for the BES daemon. Using this, it will be easy to build
regression tests for the ugrid function and, most importantly, does
not require (re)building or (re)running the server over and over again
while developing tests.

Here's how to use besstandalone:

    besstandalone -c bes.conf -i <<some *.bes command file>>

** Examples

The first example will send the server (really the besstandalone test
framework) a request for data using the function and instruct the
server to return a DAP binary response object. To see that object's
contents, it is piped in the 'getdap' utility

    besstandalone -c bes.conf -i test4_as_dap_response.bes | getdap -M -

(NB: getdap was built as part of the overall server build and is on PATH
because you ran 'source spath.sh in $prefix.)

The output looks like:

The data:
Structure {
    Float64 X[nodes = 3474];
    Float64 Y[nodes = 3474];
    Float64 nodedata[nodes = 3474];
    Int32 element[three = 3][tris = 6342];
} construct = { {-63.1688499450684, -63.4092788696289,
-63.3081588745117, ...

The second example will make the same data subsetting request, but add
that the data should be returned in a netCDF 3 data file:

    besstandalone -c bes.conf -i test4_as_nc3_response.bes > output.nc
    ncdump -h output.nc

Other *.bes commands in the ugrid_project directory do other things,
like perform regular reads from the two ample data files included
here.

The two command files are pretty easy to understand. A running instance of
Hyrax has a front end module that forms these commands based on the URLs its
sent.
 
Notes:

The bes.conf file in this directory is specially hacked for testing
the ugrid function. It has the data root set to this directory, so all
paths to the data can just start with '/' and the special data files 
used for testing can be right here - no need to install the data files.
If you use the server, you will need to install the data and edit the
*.bes files to match its data root directory.

Here's how to use the BES server to run these tests:

Copy the data to $prefix/share/hyrax/data/nc, then:

besctl start
bescmdln -p 10022 -h localhost -i <<some *.bes command file>>
besctl stop

Note that this is not Hyrax per se, but just the BES part of Hyrax.
