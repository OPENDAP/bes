Version 3.10.4 (23 April 2014)

Changed default behavior for handelr so that it is explicitly set
to ShowSharedDimensions=true

Version 3.10.3 (10 September 2013)

Minor organizational changes.

Version 3.10.2

Merged to trunk; tagged.

Version 3.10.1

Fixes for netcdf 4.1.1, which is the version in RHEL6's RPM
package. These include _not_ using NC_FIRSTUSERTYPEID and the old
nctypelen(). Those work with netcdf 4.1.2, but not 4.1.1 and they are
probably not that gereat an idea anyway.

Version 3.10.0

This version introduces some major improvements to the handler. 
Now the handler reads netcdf 4 files and externalizes all but 
a very small number of its native data types (64-bit ints, vlens 
and groups are yet to be supported). This means that most netcdf 
4 files work, not just the 'classic netcdf' files.

Also added to the handler are several configuration parameters. Briefly, they are:
* IgnoreUnknowTypes
* ShowSharedDimensions
* PromoteByteToShort

See http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/BES_-_Modules_-_The_NetCDF_Handler for the full story.

Version 3.9.3

Build fixes.

Version 3.9.2 (14 Sept 2010)

The default option is now (re)set to include those extra map/Arrays.

Version 3.9.1 (5 May 2010)

The handler now implements its own transfer_attributes code to merge
attributes from its DAS response into the DDS.

The handler now builds with netcdf 4.1

Version 3.9.0 (3 Feb 2010)

Removed dejagnu tests and added autotool tests.
RPM to use nc.conf instead of bes-nc-data.sh.
API changes to BESKeys. 
Added some Shrew build changes for the shrew hyrax project. 
Minor libdap changes.
Removed server 3 code.
Added comd file that gets the DataDDX.
Made a few DAP macro changes.
Added info about the shared dimension special option.

Version 3.8.3 (9 June 2009)

Fixes the dejagnu tests.

Version 3.8.2 (16 March 2009)

Constraint fixes and support for the service responses.

version 3.8.1 (5 Feb 2009)

Fixed a problem with the new code to represent arrays of NC_CHAR as DAP
String variables.

version 3.8.0 (29 Jan 2009)

Cleaned up error handling so that wehn installed as a BES handler there's no
spurious output to stderr.

The handler no longer packages NC_CHAR arrays as arrays of DAP Strings - an
array of char is now a string and a rank N array of char is a rank N-1 array
of string. The DAP String variables have an new attribute called
'string_length' which gives a hint to code that needs to know how much memory
allocate for the string. Inthe rank N case the 'string_length' is te size of
the Nth dimension.

The code has been updated to work with the new libdap and bes.

The handler now has standalone tests using the besstandalone test driver.

Version 3.7.9 (04 Mar 2008)

pkg and dmg build fixes using PackageMaker and DropDMG. General
configuration upgrades.

libdap namespace addition

BES exception upgrade

Version 3.7.8 (03 Dec 2007)

pkg and dmg build fixes

Version 3.7.7 (14 Nov 2007)

Support for pkg-config added.

Don't edit bes.conf during make install, but document the bes-nc-dap.sh
script and the bes-conf make target in README.

Various bug fixes.

Version 3.7.6 (13 March 2007)

Default data and bes.conf with make install, same as the other handlers in
this release.

Version 3.7.5

Better error handling.

Build fixes.

Version 3.7.4

Updates for the 1.4 release of Server 4. Also included are bug fixes, memory
leak fixes, and performance enhencements.

Version 3.7.3

The handler now builds DDS objects that contain attributes and will thus work
with server-side functions that use attributes.

Added support for compressed data.

Added new module build options. Now modules use the libtool -module and 
-no-version options.

The module name is now set by the bes configuration file, not in this code.

Version 3.7.2

Fix for ticket 488. Embedded double quotes in string attributes were not
escaped. The server was modified so that String attributes are now passed
through the libdap function escattr(). There may be differences for some
String attributes in some clients as a result. Note that this version of the
handler requires libdap 3.7.0 or greater.

Version 3.7.1

This version includes a fix for bug 435. There are serveral data handlers
that use the same names for externally visible functions. That's fine when
the handlers are executables, but not so when they are shared object
libraries. The function named have been changed.

Version 3.7.0

This version of the netCDF handler includes an executable for use with
Server3 and a shared-object library (aka module) for use with Server4. This
is a source release to support the Server4 1.2 beta release and has not been
tested with Server3, although there should be no problems.

Version 3.6.0

This version of the netcdf handler builds with libdap 3.6.0.

Patrice Dumas has contributed improvements to the spec file used to build the
RPM packages.

Misc. fixes for the handler when used with Server4 (which is in development).

Version 3.5.2

Fix for ticket 281: int variable break on 64 bit machines. The fix involved
using nc_var_get_int() in place of nc_var_get_long in NCArray::read() and
using NC_INT in place of NC_LONG in read's switch statement.

Version 3.5.1

Bug fix: The handler did not process arrays of bytes correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The handler now works with the new dap server configuration.

Removed the libnc-dods software. The OPeNDAP-netCDF client library is now
in a separate CVS module named libnc-dap. 

This software now uses automake and a modern autoconf. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

01/27/03 jhrg

This code now builds with gcc 3.2 in addition to VC++ and gcc 2.95.3.

The software has been changed to work with DAP 3.3.

The configure script requires autoconf 2.13, even though the rest of the
DODS/NVODS software using autocond 2.53. This is because the UD macros from
Unidata don't work with the newer autoconf. I understand that they will soon
enough...
