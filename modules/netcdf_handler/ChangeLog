	coverity fixes

2015-10-01  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of
	changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and
	BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression
	cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache
	configuration collisions with various handlers that also were
	utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by
	calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir,
	BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we
	specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from
	the other caches.

2015-09-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/modules'

2014-12-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added module name and version info to Makefile.am
	This change was made to support the modules build where the autoconf
	symbols PACKAGE_NAME and _MODULE are defined by the bes configure
	script. This meant that the version response from the bes was useless
	since it listed every module as 'bes' and gave the bes' version
	number.

2014-09-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed the old OPENDAP_DEBUG_OPTIONS macro from many configure.ac
	files. Fixed some param initializations; method overloads (virtual
	methods that lacked 'const'). Other warnings.

2014-09-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified the code in NCStructure so that it uses the transform_to_dap4() in Constructor.

2014-08-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added NCStructure::transform_to_dap4() so that the NCStructure object gets built correctly. I also had to undo a change made some time ago to libdap's Constructor::serialize() method where Constructor::read() was _not_ called. To get NCStrucutre to work on compound nested structures, I had to uncomment that call to Constructor::read() (NB: I could have specialized the serialize() method here in NCStructure, but I thought maybe my commenting out Constructor::read() was a bit to hasty a decision). So, for right now, Constructor::serialize() calls Constructor::read() and the code here (and in the other handlers I've worked on so far) works. Some tests are broken in libdap, but I wonder if the test code might be at fault...

2012-02-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for netcdf-4.1.1 (Removed the NC_FIRSTUSERTYPEID hack - bad
	idea)

2012-02-07  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	3.10.1

2012-02-07  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2011-12-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added include for NCRequestHandler so that we could use it to
	access the run-time param PromoteByteToShort.

2011-12-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed missing gmon.out in bes-testsuite/Makefile.am CLEANFILES

	M    bes-testsuite/Makefile.am

2011-12-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the NC.PromoteByteToShort option. This fixes a problem where
	signed Byte values 'lost' their sign (see ticket 1850). This has
	never been a big deal with Byte variables, but for attributes it
	can be a real source of confusion because attributes' values are
	rendered to text. If the sign is not present, it's hard for the
	client to infer that one was originally present.

2011-12-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed test baselines; I changed the number of significant digits used
	when printing attribute values to address a bug where values were being
	rounded to values that were off by 1 digit in the Nth place where N was
	15 or 7 for 64- or 32-bit reals.

2011-11-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed ticket 1788 - the code that converts floats and double
	attribute values to strings was not handling precision correctly
	and rounding errors were creeping into the DAS/DDX. I dropped the
	precision of floats to 9 digits and doubles to 16 decimal digits.

2011-10-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updates for the new DDX tests... nearly done

2011-10-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified configure so that this code builds only the so version of
	the library by default. Fixed some DDX tests to work with the new
	libdap code.

2011-10-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for ticket 1558: The handler now uses the xdap_accept context
	to switch between showing shared dimensions and not (unless that
	parameter is explicitly set in the configuration file).

2011-10-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added to test using the xdap_accept context to trigger various behaviors.

	Hyrax 1.8

2011-09-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added missing files for the distribution.

2011-09-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added.

2011-09-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	gcc/++ 4.0.x does not support the vector<>.data() method, so I
	dropped back to using &var[0] (in place of the less hacky
	var.data()). Also fixed a test that somehow got garbage in the
	XML.

2011-09-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the TypeName attribute to NC_OPAQUEs; updated tests.

2011-09-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added. For enum tests.

2011-09-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed old code - shortened most of the scalar read() mfuncs (for
	the integral types) by assuming that the DDS is built correctly.
	The code was testing that the datatype return by nc_inq_* matched
	the class (NCByte, NCInt32, ...) but that's not necessary (if the
	DDS was built correctly in the first place). Also, the code was
	using a 'type-safe' function for each read, but the new code for
	compound/user-defined types needs general functions, which also
	happen to be a bit easier to use, so I switched to those in most
	places. NB: The NCFloat32 and NCFloat64 classes use the older code
	with the type-safe functions so they can serve as a template if I
	need to switch back.

2011-09-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for scalar and array enums, including tests. NetCDF
	Enums are represented using integral types (byte, ..., uint32). If
	an enum uses a 64-bit int the handler either elides the variable
	and writes a message to stderr or throws an exception, depending
	on the value of the NC.IgnoreUnknwonTypes parameter.

2011-09-16  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for both scalars and arrays of the NC_OPAQUE type,
	including regression tests. NC_OPAQUE variables are represented as
	arrays of Bytes.

2011-09-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed some #define NETCDF_VERSION hackery (which made looking at
	the code easier). These will break the netcdf 3 builds.

2011-09-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Last bit of hackery for support for nested structures with fields
	that are arrays and arrays of nested structures with fields that
	are arrays. Includes tests.

2011-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed instrumentation inadvertently checked in.

2011-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for Nested structures (aka compounds) with arrays
	and arrays of structures with nested structures with arrays in
	them. No tests yet.

2011-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for nested structures and included tests for the
	same. Next Structure members that are arrays...

2011-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added regression tests for the new structure (netcdf4 compound)
	code. Still a work in progress.

2011-09-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	cleaned up the NCArray refactor. This just removed #if 0... #endif
	and commented-out lines

2011-09-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More changes for compound types - arrays are now supported.
	Recursive compounds not so much... Also refactored NCArray.

2011-09-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Initial support for compound types. This code supports compound
	variables (scalars, not arrays) and compound attributes (scalars
	and vectors). Nested compounds are not supported yet. Two new data
	files, with cdl, have been added to data/nc4_test_files and there
	are bescmd files for them, too. The tests themselves have not been
	added, however. Also, the tests have been partitioned into two
	parts, one for netcdf4-only.

2011-09-07  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The handler now builds and passes make check using both netcdf 3
	and netcdf 4.

2011-09-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed bogus define of NETCDF_VERSION compile-time constant.

2011-09-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for the compilation problem reported by Patrick - I goofed
	and checked in a merge that hosed some #if ... #endif stuff.

	The configure script now figures out the major version number of
	the netcdf library; the support for the new datatypes uses this so
	that the handler will still compile with an old version of the
	library (that will lack the new constants, et c., for the new
	netcdf 4 datatypes).

	M    configure.ac

2011-08-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Support for the new methods in libdap used to build the DDX using

	NB: The HDF5 handler seems to be broken WRT the DDX, both with

	I fixed tickets 1244 and 1247: The Grid of CHARS now shows up as a
	N-1 dim grid of strings as opposed to an N-1 Array of strings.
	Also, there is a new parameter to nc_read_descritors() that
	controls whether arrays that are also maps are included in the
	DDS. Now they aer not included by default.

	Test baseline modified to match the new behavior of
	nc_read_descriptors which now will elide an array if it has been
	used as a Grid's Map. Also fixed is the test for bears.nc - the
	first variable is now a Grid, although it's a two dimensional Grid
	of Strings and not a three dimensional grid of characters. This is
	because of the other fix where an Array of Char is now represented
	as a String.

	dimension lengths when computing the size of the Nth dimension
	of a NC_CHAR array. see ticket 1244. I added a test using bears.nc.
	This fix also is for a related problem were the first grid in

	A    http://scm.opendap.org/svn/branch/netcdf_handler/3.8.0

2009-01-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a call to ErrMsgT() to the nc_handler.cc main() function. This
	replaces all the many calls to this function that were scattered
	throughout the handler code (but are only used by the now unsupported
	CGI version of the code).

2009-01-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed code that wrote errors using the ErrMsgT() function since
	those were for the CGI version of the handler and that's no longer
	actively supported. We can add a call to the nc_handler.cc if needed.
	Also, I added comments to the function sin the ncdds.cc and ncdas.cc
	files and removed lots of old code that was not being used.

2009-01-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I modified the netcdf handler so that the NC_CHAR type is handled
	in a more sensible way. Now scalar and vector NC_CHAR variables in
	netCDF are represented as strings in DAP while 2+ dimension
	NC_CHAR variables are DAP String arrays. I added tests for this,
	as well. Also, when a string variable is made an attribute is
	added to the dataset that provides a client with the length of the
	string. In the case on an array of strings, it's the length of the
	longest string. This is really a hint only - it's easy to figure
	out for netCDF files a useful for clients that use the netCDF API.

	nc_handler.cc, NCRequestHandler.cc: The DDS/DataDDS now return
	DDS objects loaded with attributes.

2006-12-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	NCMofule.cc: Indenting

2006-12-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	NCRequestHandler.cc: Fix for ticekt #720: The DDS and DataDDS
	type factories were being deleted and then the CE was being
	evaluated; this breaks when the CE contains a constant since
	the factory is used to make a variable to hold the constant's
	value. I removed the delete calls and add code to the BES to
	handle the clean up of the DDS/Factory.

2006-11-23  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Added a dump method to the Module class for BES debugging.

2006-11-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ncdas.cc: In July I switched from C's sprintf() function to C++
	string streams to make the value to string conversions (for float
	and double, maybe others). However, the precision of the reps
	was changed which caused the attribute values to be wrong when
	read from a server newer than the pre-July code. I added
	setprecision() calls where Float32 uses 10 and Float64 17 and
	fixed the problem.

2006-11-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ncdas.cc: Modified the way attributes with type NC_BYTE
	are represented. Now the values are cast to 'int' before
	the string representation is made. This prevents values
	above 128 from making odd print reps which show up as
	blanks or unicode caharacters.

2006-11-03  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	The netcdf handler uses a dap dependent bes, so use the --dap-libs
	option on bes-config. Was setting BES_LDFLAGS and using BES_LIBS.
	Now using BES_LIBS only.
	
	M    configure.ac
	M    conf/bes.m4

2006-11-02  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	ConstraintEvaluator is now a part of the BESDDSResponse and
	BESDataDDSResponse classes instead of BESDataHandlerInterface. Any
	Error exceptions need to be caught in the request handlers and
	converted into BESHandlerException, which is the non-fatal
	exception.
	
	M    NCRequestHandler.cc

2006-11-01  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	After adding basetype using add_var, which duplicates the basetype
	passed in, delete the basetype. Also, close the netcdf file after
	reading variables and attributes and dataset.
	
	M    ncdas.cc
	M    ncdds.cc

2006-10-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	nc_handler.cc: Factored some duplicated code from main().

2006-09-27  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	--without-bes now works for the different handler directories as
	well as for the dap-server directory. cedar-handler requires bes.
	If --without-bes is not specified then either --with-bes is looked
	at if specified, or the bes-config script is looked for.

2006-09-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	nc_handler.cc: Modified so that the DDS includes attributes. This was
	done so that the new geogrid function could use attributes to determine
	which dimensions are latitude and longitude.

2006-09-15  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Added default host and port information to the bes configuration
	file. Added ascii_module, usage_module and www_module to the list
	of modules to load in the bes configuration file. Spec update per
	Patrice. Building _module library without version information and
	as a module.

	Changed parameter names that start with OPeNDAP to BES and added
	BES to the beginning of the Catalog parameters. Added the
	compression parameters to tell BES where to uncompress files, what
	are compressed files, and what script to use to uncompress the
	compressed data files.

	M    opendap.ini

	Added support for compressed data sets by adding the method
	'access' to the container class. When access is called it
	determines if the file is compressed or not, if it is it
	uncompresses it.

	M    NCRequestHandler.cc

	Changed the module loading to include the name of the module so
	that it can be set in the bes configuration file.

	ncdas.cc: Now escapes attribute values when those are Strings
	using libdap's escattr(). I rewrote the function that builds the
	print representation of the attributes using stringstream in place
	of the older sprintf() version.

2006-07-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updates for bug 435 fixes (netcdf_handler.spec and configure.ac updated
	for the version number; NEWS and ChangeLog for the fix).

2006-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	dap_cmdmodule library renamed to dap_cmd_module so that all loaded
	module libraries are named <something>_module

2006-07-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	nc_hander.cc, ncdas.cc, ncdds.cc, NCRequestHandler.cc: The function
	read_descriptors(...) was renamed to nc_read_descriptors(...) to avoid
	a name collision with the read_descriptors(...) function in the
	freeform handler. I made a similar change to the function that builds
	the DAS.

2006-06-30  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	In the help response added begin and end tags called handler to
	separate the different hander help responses and added a tag
	called name within the handler tag to say which handler this help
	is for, what requests this handler handles, and what version this
	handler is. Removed the file nc_module.cc

2006-06-20  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	opendap.ini: Modified for my development machine. YMMV

2006-05-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Makefile.am: Changed the way libnc_module is linked so that on
	OS/X it does not require libnc_handler. This is OK on linux, but
	will be hard to handle for many admins should we be required to
	support an OS/X binary release.

	configure.ac: Now searches for the bes libraries and includes
	the netcdf module in the build if they are found. It's no longer
	necessary to use the --with-bes unless you have an odd setup.

2006-01-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Commented out the BuildRequires line in netcdf_handler.spec for

	machine and don't want to install packages there.

2006-01-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified netcdf_handler.cc so that it no longer calls any of the
	libdap iostreams methods (which have been removed from libdap).

2006-01-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed set_mime-test() in nc_handler.cc so that it uses stdout
	and not cout. I removed the iostreams versions of the
	set_mime...() function from libdap in version 3.6.

2006-01-17  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Updated for version 3.5.2

2006-01-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for ticket 281: int variables break the netcdf handler on
	64bit machines. The problem was in read(). In that method we test
	for the case where the variable is type NC_LONG (but NC_LONG is
	#defined to NC_INT!). In fact there are no 64 bit integers in
	NetCDF3. However, probably because the word 'long' was used, the
	type long was used to hold the result and thus the function
	nc_var_get_long() was called. On a 64bit machine that reads the
	C/C++ type 'long' which is a 64bit int while the data were 32bit
	ints.

2004-07-09  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-4-7FCS

2004-03-25  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Makefile.in: There was a persistent problem with the build
	failing because make thought it had to build netcdf.h (when it
	should be found in the DODS_ROOT/include dir). The fix was to
	rebuild the dependencies *after* building and installing in
	src/nc3-dods. 

2004-03-09  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* This code no longer uses the Pix classes.

	* Translation of Structures is almost there. Missing is
	translation of the attributes.

	* Changed the implementation of the netCDF 2 interface. This
	software now uses the Unidata emulation code in v2i.c. See the
	README in lnetcdf.

2004-02-24  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Replaced the old version of ncdump with the version found in the
	3.5.1 distribution of netCDF from Unidata. Over time I'll migrate
	the entire code base to 3.5.1. This version of ncdump uses the
	netCDF 3.x interface which is where translation is currently
	supported. It will take a little extra time to back port it to the
	netCDF 2.x interface.

	* Check in of Reza's translation code. This version of the OPeNDAP
	netCDF CL can read from data sources that have Structures. Future
	versions will read Grids w/o the extra map vectors (i.e., the
	duplicates held outside the Grid) and Sequences (using a scheme
	Reza N and Joe W developed where an unconstrained Sequence has a
	default constraint of 100 elements).

2004-02-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged release-3-4-2FCS.

2004-02-16  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Bug fix: I added a declaration of nc_delete as extern "C". This
	was in response to a bug report on dods@unidata.ucar.edu. Look in
	lnetcdf/netcdf.h and Dnetcdf.h.

2003-12-08  Yuan Ho  <yuanho@ucar.edu>

        * Merge release-3-4 into trunk.

2003-05-02  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Patch to the Fortran/fort-control.c file. This provides fixes
	needed to use the library with the new Fortran calls that are part
	of NetCDF 3.5. This is a temporary fix from Yuan Ho (Thanks!)
	until Reza can get the code completely switched over to 3.5

2003-09-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* I modified the read() method implementations so that they test
	the new in_selection property. If it is true, the methods will
	read values even if the send_p property is not true. This is so
	that variables used in the selection part of the CE, or as
	function arguments, will be read. See bug 657. (jimg)

	* Fixed char vs. byte and long vs. nclong error checks. (reza) 

	* Removed #pragma interface directives for the OS X. (rmorris)

	* Updated the servers to netCDF-3 and fixed error handling between
	client and server. (reza)

	* Added support for Cray multi-processor (CRAYMPP) interfaces,
	they use processor element 0 for all non-CrayMPP platforms. The
	Fortran interface needs them for a clean build. (reza)

	* Fixed unnecessary nc_sync() calls in netCDF code to improve NFS
	performance. (reza)
	
	* Win32 build changes (rmorris)

2003-04-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-3-1.

	* Linux build fixes; some changes were made to the Makefile.in
	files, esp in the Fortran bindings, and some generated files were
	removed from CVS so that they would not get included in the
	distributions or confused the nightly builds.

2003-04-23  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* The win32 build files were lost and added back into the code.

2003-01-27    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* merged with release-3-2-8.

	* I removed tests for the Progress Indicator from the configure.in
	and configure scripts. Also removed was the libdap++-gui.a library
	and any use of it by the Makefile.in templates. Finally, the
	src/packages/libtcl and libtk directories were removed (from the
	cvs repository; they are in the src/packages/Attic directory).
	This removes all vestiges of the tcl/tk based progress indicator
	from our code.

	* Fixed call to Connect::request_dds(...). The local method
	request_Cdds(...) uses Connect's new version of request_dds(...).
	This file was 'fixed' once to use my first try at a new interface
	for Connect. I then fixed Connect some more and broke this code
	again... I think the current interface supported by Connect is
	much better.

	* Memory free errors found by Purity (pwest).

	* Memory leaks and a read error fixed (pwest).

	* Fixes for the IteratorAdapter.

	* Fixes to the Makefile.in.

	* Changes for gcc 3.2 build (which now works).

2002-12-16  Ethan Davis  <edavis@ucar.edu>

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.in, ncdump/Makefile.in,
	nc_test/Makefile.in: removed all references to XTRALIBS, this
	function now handled by libcurl (curl-config script).

	* nc_test/Makefile.in (Repository): change use of 'm4' to '$M4'.

	* configure.in, configure: added setting of M4 environment variable.

2002-04-30    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-7.

2002-04-25  Ethan Davis  <edavis@ucar.edu>

	* Makefile.in: remove config.status dependency in Makefile
	target.

2002-04-17    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* nc_test/nc_test.c (NC_TEST): Now uses ** instead of *** for tests.

	* Dnc.cc (ncopen): Fixed bug 393.

	* lnetcdf/lv2i.c (NCadvise): Fixed garbled messages.

	* Added version support (Reza).

2001-08-30  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	release-3-2. 

2001-08-30  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fix for bug #202: The client library now checks for incoming
	Error objects. (From Reza)

	* Fix for bug #217: The tests now work; the problem was in the code
	that runs the tests and/or sets up the test dataset. (From Reza)

	* Fix for bugs #71 and #90: An Error object is now returned when
	a URL references a dataset that does not exist. (from Reza)

2001-06-19  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2 head (tagged release-3-2-3). The next
	merge should use update -j release-3-2-3 -j release-3-2.

	* Moved most of the code in main() inside the try block (for all
	three handlers).

	* Cleaned up for switch from nph-* to nph-dods. (ethan)

	* Fixed tar and binary-tar targets. (ethan)

	* Paths are now relative where possible

	* Fixed exception handlers to return correct error codes. (reza)

2000-12-06  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed the build (removed nph-nc install, etc.)

2000-01-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed the build on little-endian machines.

1999-11-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	release-3-1-1 -j release-3-1.

	* Added info about header files.  Also updated some URLs (Ethan).

	* Removed incompatibilities in error handling and added support
	for scalar types (Reza).

	* Fixed: Reza fixed the IMAP bug.

1999-08-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* This code now supports the netCDF 3.x library.

1999-05-07  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* String-->string

1999-05-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added test-coverage target to Makefile.in

1999-01-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* The server now registers the file name properly. This ensures
	that the new projection functions can call the read() member
	function and not fail.

1998-11-11  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed a resource leak when working with local files.

1998-11-02  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>
