In this directory there are two nc4 files that both use the netcdf 4 API
but only the netCDF3 data model. nc4_nc_classic_no_comp.nc is a version
without internal compression while ..._comp.nc is one with. Both were made
using ncgen (and nccopy for the compressed version). 

Note that even though these files use the netcdf 3 data model, since they
were made using the netcdf 4 api, they can only be read using that API (but
all that needs to be done for netcdf 3 data model and API code is to relink
with the new library).

How the files were made:

To make a netcdf4 file that uses the NC_CLASSIC_MODEL (but can be chunked
and/or compressed), use ncgen -k 4 <file>. To make source code you can hack
to actually do the chunking and/or compression, use -lc too, like this:
ncgen -k 4 -lc nc4_nc_classic_no_comp.ncgen > mk_nc4_nc_classic.c. Or make
the nc4_nc_classic file with compression using nccopy like this:
nccopy -d 9 -k 4 nc4_nc_classic_no_comp.nc nc4_nc_classic_comp.nc
