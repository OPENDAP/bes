/* 
 * $Log: NCFloat64.h,v $
 * Revision 1.12  2005/04/19 23:16:18  jimg
 * Removed client side parts; the client library is now in libnc-dap.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2005/04/08 17:08:47  jimg
 * Removed old 'virtual ctor' functions which have now been replaced by the
 * factory class code in libdap++.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2005/03/31 00:04:51  jimg
 * Modified to use the factory class in libdap++ 3.5.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2005/01/26 23:25:51  jimg
 * Implemented a fix for Sequence access by row number when talking to a
 * 3.4 or earlier server (which contains a bug in is_end_of_rows()).
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2004/11/30 22:11:35  jimg
 * I replaced the flatten_*() functions with a flatten() method in
 * NCAccess. The default version of this method is in NCAccess and works
 * for the atomic types; constructors must provide a specialization.
 * Then I removed the code that copied the variables from vectors to
 * lists. The translation code in NCConnect was modified to use the
 * new method.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2004/10/22 21:51:34  jimg
 * More massive changes: Translation of Sequences now works so long as the
 * Sequence contains only atomic types.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2004/09/08 22:08:22  jimg
 * More Massive changes: Code moved from the files that clone the netCDF
 * function calls into NCConnect, NCAccess or nc_util.cc. Much of the
 * translation functions are now methods. The netCDF type classes now
 * inherit from NCAccess in addition to the DAP type classes.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2003/12/08 18:06:37  edavis
 * Merge release-3-4 into trunk
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2003/09/25 23:09:36  jimg
 * Meerged from 3.4.1.
 *
 * Revision 1.3.4.1  2003/06/24 11:36:32  rmorris
 * Removed #pragma interface directives for the OS X.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2002/05/03 00:01:52  jimg
 * Merged with release-3-2-7.
 *
 * Revision 1.2.4.1  2001/12/26 03:32:24  rmorris
 * Removed redundant default args.  VC++ only allows them to be specified
 * a single time.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/10/06 01:22:02  jimg
 * Moved the CVS Log entries to the ends of files.
 * Modified the read() methods to match the new definition in the dap library.
 * Added exception handlers in various places to catch exceptions thrown
 * by the dap library.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1999/07/28 00:22:43  jimg
 * Added
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1999/05/07 23:45:32  jimg
 * String --> string fixes
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1996/09/17 17:06:26  jimg
 * Merge the release-2-0 tagged files (which were off on a branch) back into
 * the trunk revision.
 *
 * Revision 1.3.4.2  1996/07/10 21:44:04  jimg
 * Changes for version 2.06. These fixed lingering problems from the migration
 * from version 1.x to version 2.x.
 * Removed some (but not all) warning generated with gcc's -Wall option.
 *
 * Revision 1.3.4.1  1996/06/25 22:04:27  jimg
 * Version 2.0 from Reza.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1995/03/21  20:58:19  jimg
 * Resolved conflicts between my (jhrg) files and those checked in by Reza.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1995/03/16  16:56:31  reza
 * Updated for the new DAP. All the read_val mfunc. and their memory management
 * are now moved to their parent class.
 * Data transfers are now in binary while DAS and DDS are still sent in ASCII.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1995/02/10  04:57:24  reza
 * Added read and read_val functions.
