ABOUT

  The ais-tool program is a simple network interface that enables the
  client-side Ancillary Information Service to be used as a simple network
  service. This implementation is experimental; what we've learned from it
  will be used to derive requirements for a better version. This software
  should not be included in the dap-server distributions.
  
  Update: Build with libdap 3.7.x. jhrg 05/03/06
