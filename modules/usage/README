Updated for version 4.1.6 of the dap-server package 

This package contains general purpose handlers for use with the new
Hyrax data server. These are the Usage, ASCII and HTML form handlers.
Each takes input from a 'data handler' and returns a HTML or plain text
response --- something other than a DAP response object.

The older versions of this package contained the 'Server3' CGI software; that
has been removed.

Hyrax BES module

  For Hyrax this package includes the library modules that can be
  dynamically loaded into the OPeNDAP Back-End Server (BES) as well as
  help files for the modules. To load these modules into the BES
  simply edit the BES configuration file, its default location in
  /etc/bes/bes.conf. Directions for editing the configuration file
  follow, however, you can run the bes-dap-data.sh script to edit the
  script automatically. Or, if building from source you can use the
  bes-conf target of make to run the script for you.

  To edit the bes.conf script by hand:

  Set the BES user, group and admin email (see the comments in the
  bes.conf file for instructions).

  Change the parameter BES.modules to include the three dap-server
  modules ascii, usage and www as follows (example assumes you have
  installed the netcdf_handler module):

<code>
    BES.modules=dap,cmds,ascii,usage,www,nc
</code>

  And add the following three lines below this:

<code>
    BES.module.ascii=/usr/lib/bes/libascii_module.so
    BES.module.usage=/usr/lib/bes/libusage_module.so
    BES.module.www=/usr/lib/bes/libwww_module.so
</code>

  Also add the following near where the bes_help files are specified.

<code>
    DAP-SERVER.Help.TXT=/usr/share/bes/dap-server_help.txt
    DAP-SERVER.Help.HTML=/usr/share/bes/dap-server_help.html
    DAP-SERVER.Help.XML=/usr/share/bes/dap-server_help.html
</code>

  The next time the BES is started these modules will be loaded and
  the ascii, info_page, and html_form responses will be supported as
  well as the help files for dap-server specifying the syntax of these
  commands.
