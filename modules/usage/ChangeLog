	Merge pull request #59 from OPENDAP/cache_fix
	Cache fix

	Clean up residual cache code. Add a note about fcntl(2) versus flock(2)
	Both fcntl(2) and flock(2) can be used for advisory locking. The
	BESFileLockingCache uses fcntl() and that impacts testing since
	all of our testing is single-process. Not a huge deal, but if we
	want more complete testing we'll need to change how we implement
	the locks or use multi-process testing.

	Modest fixes to the test code in cacheT

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/cacheT_fix' into cache_fix

	This code now builds and passes the tests we have...
	But we might ned or want to write more/better tests for the cache.

2017-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix to BESFSDir for the opendir/readdir race condition.
	When two processes are using the same directory and one process makes
	and deletes files in the directory at the same time as the other
	process uses opendir/readdir to iterate over the files in the
	directory, it's possible for file names to show up in entries returned
	by readdir that no longer exist (i.e., stat(2) returns -1). It's better
	to ignore this than signal an error (IMHO).

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:/opendap/bes

	Removed errant tab in Makefile.am

	Fixed an error in both scale_util.cc and its test code (ScaleUtilTest.cc)
	In scale_util.cc:get_gcp_data() the code samples the data and uses
	both integer division and 'increment by sample factor' and those
	were producing an off by one error in some cases.

	Removed ScaleUtilTest from bes/functions for now.

	Fixed BesDebug --> BESDebug and removed some generated files.

	Ugh. Still recovering from geo-functions merge mess - removed generatged files
	... From gateway bes-testsuite

	Added bes-testsuite for w10n handler

	Added the bes-testsuite dir back in for the gateway handler

2017-03-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed all the unused lines from the pvolT BES keys file

	Patched the pvolT test so that it writes temp files to ./cache
	This keeps those temp files from conflicting with the BESKeys use of
	a regex in the BES.Include line in one of it's test files. This is not
	a real fix for the problem, which will take a bit more time - and an
	understanding of the BES File and Dir classes...

	Fixed the various badness of my previous merge of geo-functions.

	OK. Added the gateway and w10n handlers back in.

2017-03-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added comment to ContainerStorageVolatile about needing BESKeys file

	pvolT now uses separate tests.
	I'm not sure this really addresses the underlying issue with the pvolT
	and keysT conflict, but is makes the test cleaner and might help debug
	the issue.

	Added options to unit-tests keysT and pvolT

2017-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Unit tests in dispatch fail when run in parallel. This is a fix.
	The setup() code in pvolT seems to conflict with the code in keysT
	when keysT starts and then pvolT starts and finishes before keysT
	finishes. I have no idea why, but the text in the pvolT's setup()
	shows up in keysT. It turns out that the setup() code is not needed,
	and removing it seems to fix the problem. Seems to...

	Copy pasta error

	False result from the DAP4 CE parser not throws Error
	This matches the behavior in the bes/dap module.

2015-12-28  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Patched error handling problems in Transmitter implmentations. In particular: 1) Ensured that libdap::Error objects are converted to BESDapError objects when caught. and 2) Catch and rethrow BESError objects whenever they could be thrown so they don't get swept up as unidentified errors in a catch(...) clause.

2015-12-23  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Fixed bug wherein BESErrors were not being specifically caught in ASCII land.

	Fixed bug wherein BESErrors were not being specifically caught in ASCII land.

	Expanded try block in send_basic_ascii() so all DAP errors are correctly handled.

2015-11-28  Patrick West  <pwest@vsto.tw.rpi.edu>

	configure.ac was removed by accident.
	Also needed to add DAP_CFLAGS to default includes to get everything to

	Coverity fixes

2015-10-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified this code and it's baselines to stop computing the checksum
	This is one (negative) consequence of removing the checksum
	computation in intern_data() - the ascii response doesn't get
	the checksums. (NB: Though this meant that the DAP4 ascii was
	different from the DAP2 - now it's the same I think).

2015-10-01  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache configuration collisions with various handlers that also were utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir, BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from the other caches.

2015-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Bumped up the version info.
	The Makefile.am holds the version info that is returned by
	bescmdln "show version;" and it was behind the value in
	configure. I can see this is going to be a pain...

2015-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified Makefile.am for distcheck combined with the modules build of the BES

2015-03-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BESAsciiTransmit now works with server functions
	I moved basic code and logic from BESDapResponseBuilder
	send_dap2_data() into send_basic_ascii(). It's still a little raw, but
	all the tests pass and server functions work including functions used
	in combination with selection expressions against Sequences.

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/dap4'
	Conflicts:
		configure.ac
	Fixed the conflicts and copied over the lost file handler_tests_macros.m4
	in asciival/tests. The tests, a good example of how to use data responses
	instead of invoking a handler on a real data file, now work.

2014-12-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This was a second patch from LARC and had to be partly applied by hand.

2014-11-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tweaked the config.status dep so that it includes $(top_srcdir).

	Applied patch from LARC to the HTML form.

2014-11-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes for the bes modules branch.
	The Makefile.am files and configure.ac have been modifid so that
	the handler can build as part of the bes modules 'unified' build
	as well as the standard build.

2014-11-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Now builds as part of the unified build
	Modified the Makefile.am files so that they work with both the
	statndard and unified builds. Added DAP_MODULES automake conditional
	to configure.ac. Added gitignore.

2014-09-18  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	dap-server: Changed Get as NetCDF-4 button to utilize the DAP2 based response (which works without DAP4 BES changes).

2014-09-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed the old OPENDAP_DEBUG_OPTIONS macro from many configure.ac files. Subclasses for/of Sequence were not defining the length() virtual method correctly - adding 'const' quieted the warning. Fileout GDAL had an unneeded param (ConstraintEvaluator).

2014-09-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed some unneeded #defines in the Module class; removed an old relic from the dejaGNU testing framework; and tried (worked) some new setContext values in a bescmd test input file.

	Decided to punt on the newline issue with arrays of structures and such - made a ticket that we need to stop and think about how CSV data are formatted given that CSV is flat and were serializing structured data...

2014-09-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added tests for asciival for DAP4; one fails where an extra endl is printed when a structure contains an array. See the comment in print_strucure_ascii().

	Added

	removed the old ResponseHandler code (see old_and_in_the_way) and forgot to clean up the AsciiModule class and remove the include.

	Added support for DAP4. Note that nested sequences are broken in libdap, so they are broken here too.

	Added some test data (used with the dapreader handler) and input files to trigger their reads. NB: Nested sequences are broken in libdap as of now and some of the data/input files were used to look into that issue. It may be that code here is broken WRT nested seqs (almost certainly the case) but it's definitely broken in libdap, so this won't work on that case until libdap is fixed.

	fixed comments and removed some unused params

2014-09-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	data file added for tests; configure.ac updated.

	Simple types, Arrays and Structures now work for DAP4 in asciival.

	Added regression tests using dapreader and a saved .dods response from the fnoc1 dataset. Using this, tests can use a .dods (DataDDS) response from a netCDF file w/o the netCDF handler being loaded into the BES.

2009-12-29  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Shrew build changes that will hopefully lead to a version that we
	can build using NMI's B&T system. Also, I added 'cccc' targets so
	that we can take a 'metrics snapshot' without undue pain.

2009-11-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I removed the calls that request a DAS since all of our current
	handlers return a DDS that is loaded with attributes (so the DAS
	is redundant). This should fix the problem when using the ncml
	handler (which cannot build a DAS). To make this work I had to fix
	the way the variables are copied/transformed by the handler so the
	transformation operation copied the variables' attribute tables
	too. A different way to write this handler would be to subclass
	DDS and have that new DDS use a base type factory class. However,
	the problem with that is libdap copies the variables contained by
	constructor types but does not use a factory (neither does DDS,
	but since DDS has an instance of the factory that could be
	changed).

2009-11-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tweaked the FILE_METHODS define given the change in libdap - that
	symbol is now defined in the header files and not in the cc and

	Added call to www2id() in the BES Transmitter method. This ensures
	that WWW escape codes are removed before the CE is parsed (except that
	spaces and '&' are left encoded to match behavior of the current
	DDS implementation. This changes means that names can be quoted,
	allowing all kinds of unwise characters to appear in a variable name.
	See ticket 1248

	Now the WWW handler includes a button for a netCDF file return
	for data requests. This button only appears if the NetCDF file-out
	handler is defined in the BES (the test actually uses the
	tempdir parameter of the handler, so it can be fooled...

	Fixed a bug in AsciiArray that showed up int he unit tests. The

	Also, we only need the _redirect object for _values_, not for the
	dimensions (since the constructor that builds an instance from a
	BaseType * copies the dimensions).

2007-03-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed most of the unneeded code after fixing the problem
	of the missing HDF-EOS attributes (#347). This is just to
	clean up the mess of '#if 0 ... #endif' that littered the
	code.

2007-03-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed bug #347: HDF-EOS attributes did not show up in the
	HTML form interface. The problem was that HDF-EOS attributes
	use conventions that the WWW Response Handler did not recognize.
	I modified the Response Handler so that it works with a DDX
	(i.e., a DDS loaded with attributes) and that fixes the problem,
	given that the form generator code already knew how to deal
	with nested attributes.

2007-02-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Makefile.am: Added the two new README files to EXTRA_DIST.

2007-02-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I split up the README into README.cgi and README.hyrax
	so that the information about setting up the CGI server
	would be put in the dap-server-cgi package and so that
	the regular package would have a decent README. I also
	fixed some lingering issues in the spec file and Makefile.am

	AsciiArray.cc: Fix to get_shape_vector(). Instead of adding
	to vector<int> shape using *shape++ = ... I switched to
	shape.push_back(...)> I don't know that the former is wrong,
	but valgrind shows an error and I do know the latter is
	correct.

2007-02-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	get_html_form.cc, WWWArray.cc, WWWGrid.cc: Updated onfocus
	so that it shows the right text in the window status area.
	www.js: Modified so that the functions called by onfocus
	return true and set the 'window.status' variable instead of the
	defaultStatus variable (which might not have been working in
	firefox).

2007-02-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	WWWArray.cc, WWWGrid.cc: I removed the leading '//' from
	the '<!--' used to protect old browsers from JavaScript as
	per Castro, "HTML for the world wide web," P.320.

2007-02-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Lots of reformatting of code to make it easier to read.
	Fixed 766: WWWArray.cc and WWWGrid.cc both needed fixes. When
	the DDS was copied/mutated so that the variables inherit from
	the WWW* classes, the Array variables dimensions were not
	being copied (the same error was in AsciiArray.cc - also fixed
	with this commit).

	get_html_form.cc: Added some include files needed for RHEL3

2006-10-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Applied patch from Patrice Dumas which does two things:

	* it puts the substitutions in dap-server.rc and nph-dods under the
	  control of make such that the paths are the right ones

	* it adds a new configure switch --with-cgiconfdir to specify a
	* directory for dap-server.rc, such that it doesn't have to be in
	* the cgi directory with nph-dods. The default is still the same,
	* that is the default is to put it in the same directory than
	* nph-dods. It changes the default nph-dods a bit: instead of

	$dispatch = new DODS_Dispatch( "DAP2/3.7.1", "./dap-server.rc" );

	  one have

	$dispatch = new DODS_Dispatch( "DAP2/3.7.1",
			    "/usr/local/share/dap-server-cgi/dap-server.rc" );

	  That is an absolute directory is used, even if the nph-dods and the
	  dap-server.rc files are in the same directory.

	This allows to have the config file in a FHS conformant place.

2006-09-27  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	--without-bes now works for the different handler directories as
	well as for the dap-server directory. cedar-handler requires bes. If
	--without-bes is not specified then either --with-bes is looked at

	which help to make a DDS with WWW* type variables given a DDS
	with some other set of BaseType specializations (e.g., NCTypes).

2005-09-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Applied patches from Patrice Dumas which addressed several
	problems in the build process. I also changed the install
	directory from $prefix/sbin to $prefix/bin to reduce exposure of
	suid binaries in sbin in case the server is compromised (also
	suggested by Patrice). Add a .spec file from Patrice.

2005-09-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Auto reset of Subversion properties

2005-09-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified INSTALL to include the requirement that HTML::Parser be
	installed. Changed Makefile.am so that the perl modules are not
	installed as scripts but as data.

2005-09-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed libnc-dap dir; not sure how it got here. Added spec file
	from Patrice Dumas. Patched Makefile.am (patch from Patrice also).

2005-09-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed this directory.

2005-09-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	(which was the fix for the bug).

2005-08-31  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed tickets 143, 133, 121, 109.

2005-08-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Initial import.

2005-08-08  root

	Auto reset of Subversion properties

2005-07-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed #134 in Trac and also updated the build scripts to recent
	versions of autoconf, et al.

2005-07-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The Version response which uses the format handler now gets a
	version number from the Perl code, which means it will behave like
	the other responses. Also, updated the makefile for the dist and
	distcheck targets (the latter still fails on RHEL 3).

2005-07-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed ticket 121: The code was missing a needed factory class.
	Also updated the Makefile.am so as to not define
	DEFAULT_BASETYPE_FACTORY and fixed the help text in www.js and the
	reference to the help page in www_int.cc (bug 106).

2005-07-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed. Use the copy in DODS-doc/opendap_home/online_help_files

2005-07-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed Pix use.

2005-07-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2005-07-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Repaired damage to AsciiArray::get_nth_dim_size; it does not use
	ones-indexing!

2005-07-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updates to the build. Removed unused variables from www_int

2005-07-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the factory class. removed unused vars from ascii_val.cc. Added
	common_tests.exp.

2005-07-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Switched to the Factory class for DDS and fixed all but two of the
	tests.

2005-07-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed URL.

2005-07-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Uses local common_tests.exp

2005-07-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added

2005-07-07  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed bug #72. The regex \.gz|\.Z was matching anything followed
	by gz or Z and not a literal dot followed by gz or Z. Replaced \.
	with \\. as suggested by someone whose name didn't get into the
	bug report.

2005-07-07  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The distribution builds and distcheck works.

2005-07-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added Makefile.am

2005-07-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Build now works but needs tweaks before release.

2005-07-05  Rob Morris <Robert.O.Morris@jpl.nasa.gov>

	Set eol-style to native on all text file in the trunk

2005-06-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed generated build files; fixed configure.ac so that it does not
	include -gstabs when building on OS/X.

2005-06-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added config.h.in and regenerated Makefile.in. Fixed a bug in
	usage.cc: No space separated the end of the handler and its first
	option.

2005-06-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added makefile.am to asciival.

2005-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved option.V.exp to option.W.exp

2005-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	moved option.v.exp to option.w.exp

2005-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Finally seem to have exec set.

2005-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	set executable prop

2005-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	set executable prop

2005-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More property madness...

2005-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Yet another attempt at setting the properties.

2005-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified properties.

2005-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Remove exec prop; or at least tried.

2005-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Set properties on all the files here: most are text eol-style:
	native, keyword: Id, and executable only for a few files. There
	are two files that have binary content named stdin_test.

2005-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added build for usage.cc and fixed a number of small problems in
	usage.cc. The code builds but has not been tested. The 'user
	supplied docs' feature is almost certainly hosed.

2005-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Build update.

2005-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified to parse the data_root parameter.

2005-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Now uses the dap_server.rc configuration file.

2005-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Used the value of the configuration param data_root along with
	PATH_INFO to figure out where the data are. The data_root path is
	essentially a substitute for DocumentRoot. If data_root is not set
	in the config file, DocumentRoot is used in its place (by falling
	back to the old behavior of using PATH_TRANSLATED to find the data
	file).

2005-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added data_root configuration parameter.

2005-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Now builds dap_server.rc instead of dods.rc

2005-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved dods.rc to this file.

2005-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added text about Tools redesign.

2005-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added blurb about new features.

2005-05-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes to mesh with the new netcdf handler project/module. make
	install in both will now yield a running server when nph-dods and
	dods.rc are copied to a cgi-bin directory.

	Updated the old URI Copyright; removed clause about requiring credit
	in publications. This was never really intended and is probably
	unenforceable.

2005-03-16  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed List from Makefile.in dependencies. Modified AISDODSFilter
	to accommodate new changes to its parent class.

2004-02-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed WWWList from the Build.

2004-02-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed Pix code which was not building (???). Removed AsciiList from
	Build.

2004-01-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Switched from Pix to iterators. This fixes a compilation bug where the
	var(Pix&) method can't be found.

2004-01-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed case for dods_list_c since List has been removed from the DAP.
	Fixed a missed conflict from the last merge.

2004-01-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Corrected use of Connect. This code was using a constructor that
	is no longer present. The old ctor was present when the software
	used libwww.

2004-01-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I modified the DODS_MATLAB macro: it was not setting the
	matlab_lib-dir correctly because the wrong test was used when
	initially checking the value of MATLAB_LIB. In fact I cannot see
	hoe MATLAB_LIB can ever be non-zero, but I've left it alone
	because these macros are so inter-woven.

2003-12-08  edavis

	Merge release-3-4 into trunk

2003-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added test for 'ddx' extension.

2003-05-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes that add support for the DDX response. I've based this on
	Nathan Potter's work in the Java DAP software. At this point the
	code can produce a DDX from a DDS and it can merge attributes from
	a DAS into a DDS to produce a DDX fully loaded with attributes.
	Attribute aliases are not supported yet. I've also removed all
	traces of strstream in favor of stringstream. This code should no
	longer generate warnings about the use of deprecated headers.

2003-05-08  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	added include for iostream and using statements to compile

2003-05-07  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed multi-line string literals.

2003-05-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a problem in DODS_IDL where the IDL root directory was found
	only if the idl executable found by 'which' was a symbolic link to
	the real executable. This corrupted the idl library path which
	broke the idl command line client link.

2003-05-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed quotes in PACKAGES macro from "" to [].

2003-05-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for the builds

2003-05-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Switched to a DODS-specific log for the diagnostic messages. Also,
	boosted the filtering of environment variables so that taint mode
	works with perl 5.8.

2003-04-29  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed old, out of date, information. Added a pointer to the
	INSTALL-servers file.

2003-04-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for Perl 5.8.0 taint mode. 5.8 seems to be stricter about tainted
	variables (which is good, I guess...).

2003-04-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	04/21/03 jhrg

2003-03-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added CE; This is passed to ais_tool. The AISDODSFilter object
	parses it from the command line options.

2003-03-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Once the client part of the gateway has a full DataDDS, the
	AISDODSFilter object's constraint expression must be zeroed before
	calling DODSFilter::send_data().

2003-03-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added call to set_read_p() for all the variables in a DataDDS
	before the call to send_data(). This prevents the read() methods
	from being called.

2003-03-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added. Some of these files are from the asciival testsuite and
	will need editing before they can be used.

2003-03-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added.

2003-03-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Replaced call to Connect::disable_cache() with a call to
	Connect::set_cache_enable(false). The disable_cache() method no
	longer exists.

2003-02-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated DODS_GCC_VERSION so that it doesn't barf on gcc 3.x.

2003-02-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Repaired copyright.

2003-02-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the DODS_MATLAB macro so that it links the Matlab server
	correctly under ML 6 (which lacks the libmi.so library).

2003-01-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved a fix from release-3-2 *by hand* here. The variable
	path_info was not being sanitized correctly. It's such a simple
	fix...

2003-01-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	the changes never made it to the branch. I merged the entire
	branch. There maybe problems still...

2000-10-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for exception-based error reporting.

2000-10-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed lots of old macros.

2000-10-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved the CVS Log to t eh end of the file. Added Shekhar's
	changes. Added a call to handler_name(); The DODS_Dispatch object
	now uses the handler_name() routine to choose which handler to
	use. This makes it possible to use a single dispatch script for
	all types of data served by dods.

2000-10-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added functions to complete the caching system. It is still pretty
	basic...

	file to be read instead of a <data file>.html file.

2000-09-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Rearranged source files so that the CVS logs appear at the end
	rather than the start. Also made the ifdef guard symbols use the
	same naming scheme and wrapped headers included in other headers
	in those guard symbols (to cut down on extraneous file processing
	- See Lakos).

	for differences in the iostreams implementations.

2000-06-16  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the DODS_GUILIBS macro so that it includes -ldl. I used

2000-03-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for the DODS_PROG_PERL macro. It now substitutes the whole
	path. Added/changed macros for finding the various libraries used
	by DODS. There are now three marcos/variables: GUILIBS, LIBS and
	XTRALIBS. This makes it simpler to link with or without GUI
	support (see also the new libdap++-gui).

	Changes for the new organization of the source code - may be
	incomplete

1999-08-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the DODS_FIND_CWD macro. This sets DODS_CWD to the name of
	current directory. The macro name is somewhat misleading since
	DODS_CWD is the filename of the CWD, not the pathname. Suppose
	you're in /usr/local/src. DODS_CWD would be src.

1999-07-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed up the GNU tar test so that only a single line with the
	version number gets printed. Not necessary, but this makes the
	output of configure less confusing.

1999-07-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the DODS_PROG_PERL yet again because the sed regexp was
	setting $perl_ver to 5.004 and test, on Linux, whined about
	expecting integers.

1999-07-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ENDIANness.

	Added comments to describe what the overloads do. Reduced the
	number of parameters given to the ctor. Modified so that README,
	.html and directory sorting URLs are not routed to the html form
	filter. This code is now called from DODS_Dispatch.pm.

1999-06-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added server_name and request_uri procedure/fields. Added code
	that translates the extension .html into a call to the www_int
	filter. This uses the new server_name and request_uri information
	to run the filter with a complete url, which might be wasteful but
	is quick and keeps the server programs modular. Fixed the call to
	asciival so that security features are no longer circumvented. I
	used the same call-with-url technique that I used with www_int.
	Some of the help text was updated to include mention of the new
	.html feature.

1999-06-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the `parent directory' link.

1999-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved the code that escapes the query into the section for
	asciival. Since the security fixes only asciival needs special
	characters escaped (since it is still run using a subshell).

1999-05-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge with alpha-3-0-0

1999-05-25  Nathan Potter <ndp@coas.oregonstate.edu>

	This marks the end of testing for the writeval directory release 3.*.*
	The asciival code has been fairly well tested.
		- test coverage is nearly 100% in ascii_val.cc
	The writeval code has been tested only as much as previously.
		- test coverage is poor.
		- matlab testing was not done.

1999-05-25  Nathan Potter <ndp@coas.oregonstate.edu>

	*** empty log message ***

1999-05-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Retracted some of the security stuff when using the ASCII mode of
	the servers. In order to run a pipe from Perl you must use an
	intermediate shell or (maybe) explicitly open the two processes
	using open("|", ...). The later might work but does not fit well
	into the design of DODS_Dispatch.pm. In the long run, we'll have
	to change DODS_Dispatch, but for now I'm running that part of the
	server through a shell.

1999-05-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed quoting of various strings, esp the $query. Since the
	command arguments are now stored in a Perl list and passes to exec
	in that list (and not a single string), the command is not
	evaluated by the shell. Thus, quotes won't be removed by the shell
	and wind up confusing the parsers.

1999-05-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for security holes. The CWD module is no longer used; this
	makes it simpler to run perl using the -T (taint) mode. Variables
	passed to executable are scanned for nasty things (shell meta
	characters). The commands are run straight from perl, not using an
	intermediate shell.

1999-05-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Perl is now started using /bin/sh.

1999-05-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added simple test for perl. This won't do much for binaries...

1999-05-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed name_from_url(...) since int is never used.

1999-05-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed version feature and help feature so that they work with
	nph-*/version, nph-*/version/, and nph-*/ (the latter for help).
	Fixed the help message so that it does not say `Error...'
	(suggested by the GCMD).

1999-05-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the help message so that it no longer says `Error'. When a
	URL with no extension is used the help message, not the error
	message, is printed. Added use of the -v option to all calls to
	the server filter programs. The .ver/version extension now uses
	the new -V option (see DODSFilter).

1999-05-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed copyright statements. Removed more of the GNU classes.

	Merge of no-gnu branch

1999-04-23  edavis

	Added use of environment variables: HDF_PATH, MATLAB_ROOT,
	and DSP_ROOT.  Includes the use of the -d test which is not
	cross-compiler safe.

1999-04-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Uses dynamic_cast

1999-04-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed, I hope, the DODS_MATLAB test which looks around in the
	matlab root directory and finds libraries for DODS to link with.
	The code was confused because looking for libmat* in the matlab
	root finds several files under ML 5. I fixed this by starting the
	search in ML ROOT/extend.

1999-04-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	that variable will be lost.

	Added tests and an accessor function for the Accept-Encoding
	header (which CGI 1.1 passes to the cgi program using the
	environment variable HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING). When found with the
	value `deflate' the data filter
	(nc_dods, ...) is called with the -c flag which causes
	DODSFilter::send_data to try to compress the data stream using
	deflate (LZW from zlib 1.0.4). Also added a help message
	(activated with /help or /help). Fixed the error text (but it is
	often blocked by clients because of the http 400 code).

1997-06-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	First version

1997-05-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the way global attributes are ferreted out. Previously I
	had assumed that any attribute group that was not also the name of
	a variable was a group of `global' attributes. However, the new
	aliases change this. In response I've changed the way usage looks
	for global attributes; it looks for attribute groups which contain
	the strings `global' and/or `dods'. Case is not important.

1996-10-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added to DODS_PROG_BISON so that it defines DODS_BISON_VER as the

	version is simpler.

	accordingly.

1996-08-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed `DODS_DEBUG' to `DODS_DEBUG_OPTION' since I changed the
	shell variables `DEBUG' and `DEBUG2' to `DODS_DEBUG', etc. This

	`DEBUG' by the WWW library.
