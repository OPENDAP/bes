	Merge pull request #59 from OPENDAP/cache_fix
	Cache fix

	Clean up residual cache code. Add a note about fcntl(2) versus flock(2)
	Both fcntl(2) and flock(2) can be used for advisory locking. The
	BESFileLockingCache uses fcntl() and that impacts testing since
	all of our testing is single-process. Not a huge deal, but if we
	want more complete testing we'll need to change how we implement
	the locks or use multi-process testing.

	Modest fixes to the test code in cacheT

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/cacheT_fix' into cache_fix

	This code now builds and passes the tests we have...
	But we might ned or want to write more/better tests for the cache.

2017-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix to BESFSDir for the opendir/readdir race condition.
	When two processes are using the same directory and one process makes
	and deletes files in the directory at the same time as the other
	process uses opendir/readdir to iterate over the files in the
	directory, it's possible for file names to show up in entries returned
	by readdir that no longer exist (i.e., stat(2) returns -1). It's better
	to ignore this than signal an error (IMHO).

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:/opendap/bes

	Removed errant tab in Makefile.am

	Fixed an error in both scale_util.cc and its test code (ScaleUtilTest.cc)
	In scale_util.cc:get_gcp_data() the code samples the data and uses
	both integer division and 'increment by sample factor' and those
	were producing an off by one error in some cases.

	Removed ScaleUtilTest from bes/functions for now.

	Fixed BesDebug --> BESDebug and removed some generated files.

	Ugh. Still recovering from geo-functions merge mess - removed generatged files
	... From gateway bes-testsuite

	Added bes-testsuite for w10n handler

	Added the bes-testsuite dir back in for the gateway handler

2017-03-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed all the unused lines from the pvolT BES keys file

	Patched the pvolT test so that it writes temp files to ./cache
	This keeps those temp files from conflicting with the BESKeys use of
	a regex in the BES.Include line in one of it's test files. This is not
	a real fix for the problem, which will take a bit more time - and an
	understanding of the BES File and Dir classes...

	Fixed the various badness of my previous merge of geo-functions.

	OK. Added the gateway and w10n handlers back in.

2017-03-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added comment to ContainerStorageVolatile about needing BESKeys file

	pvolT now uses separate tests.
	I'm not sure this really addresses the underlying issue with the pvolT
	and keysT conflict, but is makes the test cleaner and might help debug
	the issue.

	Added options to unit-tests keysT and pvolT

2017-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Unit tests in dispatch fail when run in parallel. This is a fix.
	The setup() code in pvolT seems to conflict with the code in keysT
	when keysT starts and then pvolT starts and finishes before keysT
	finishes. I have no idea why, but the text in the pvolT's setup()
	shows up in keysT. It turns out that the setup() code is not needed,
	and removing it seems to fix the problem. Seems to...

	BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression
	cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache
	configuration collisions with various handlers that also were
	utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by
	calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir,
	BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we
	specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from
	the other caches.

2015-09-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified because a fix in libdap broke this code
	libdap was setting the output stream precision and not
	resetting it. Whne I fixed that, this code had to be updated.

2015-09-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified Makefile.am to support distcheck

2015-08-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed package.m4 in the autoconf dirs Makefile.am files

2015-05-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Halfway to removing the tests' need for the netcdf handler.
	The dapreader handler still does not process Grids correctly...

	Repaired getopt() use. Patch from O. Poplawski.

2015-04-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/fileout_json

	Modified Makefile.am to support bes distcheck

2015-04-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Version 1.0.0
2015-03-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a problem with make check
	It failed when CppUnit was not present. Now those tests
	are ignored.

2015-03-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Accommodate autoconf 2.63
	Removed -j7 from TESTSUITEFLAGS. Can still pass them in from
	the command line (make check TESTSUITEFLAGS=-j7).

2015-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/fileout_json
	Conflicts:
		unit-tests/Makefile.am

	Modified Makefile.am for distcheck combined with the modules build of the BES

2015-03-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	misspelled name in a Makefile

2015-03-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Fixed bug in loop

2015-03-11  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Renamed FoJsonTransform* and FoJsonTransmitter* to
	FoInstanceJsonTransform* and FoInstanceJsonTransmitter*
	respectively to better reflect the classes actual functionality.
	Also added string escaping to all object names in the
	ijson (FoJsonTransmitter) output to protect from crazy variable
	names breaking the validitiy of the returned JSON content.

	Renamed FoW10nJson* to FoDapJson* to better represent the actual
	functionallity of the classes. Made the json 'type' properties
	match the DAP types os the associated variables. Fixed baselines
	and testing regalia.

	Renamed array functions in a more understandable manner.

	Added special method for arrays of strings. Tidied up use of std::
	for string, Debug statements, etc.

2015-03-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed an issue with libdap::Vector::value()
	Code in FoJsonTransform inadvertently built a call to a non-existent
	version of libdap::Vector:value. I specialized the
	json_simple_type_array() method as a work-around.

2015-02-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed error in test baseline
	The test baseline abstract_object_test_DATA.json.baseline
	used six escaped double quotes that are not in the output. I
	think the escaped double quotes was something that was an issue
	but which was fixed. I modified the baseline, so the test passes,
	by removing the extra (escaped) double quotes.

	Fixed namespace error
	The function escape_for_json in namespace fojson was
	declared as string function(string &) but defined as
	string function(const string &). Different type signatures
	== different functions. So the problem was not really a
	namespace issue at all.

2015-02-20  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Fixes to fojson to correctly escape strings, and support for arrays of sting and url

	Fixes to fojson to correctly escape strings, and support for arrays of sting and url

2015-02-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2015-02-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/fileout_json

2015-02-02  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Repaired production rules so distclean works correctly.

2015-01-29  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	fileout_json: Removed copy-pasta cruft that incorrectly identified the project as fileout_netcdf

2015-01-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed dist-hook which as a hack for SVN

	Removed use of case libdap::dods_url4_c
	This type constant was removed from libdap.

2014-12-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/dap4'

2014-12-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Remove package.m4 from the repo

2014-12-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed configure.ac after the merge with the modules branch.

2014-12-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added module name and version info to Makefile.am
	This change was made to support the modules build where the autoconf
	symbols PACKAGE_NAME and _MODULE are defined by the bes configure
	script. This meant that the version response from the bes was useless
	since it listed every module as 'bes' and gave the bes' version
	number.

2014-11-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Build changes.
	Tweaked	the config.status dep so that it includes $(top_srcdir).
	Added the new bes.conf.modules.in to EXTRA_DIST	  in Makefile.am.

2014-11-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added bes.conf.modules.in
	Needed for the modules build.

2014-11-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added tmp using the .gitignore trick to add empty dirs

	Changes for the 'modules' build.

	A    https://scm.opendap.org/svn/branch/fileout_json/dap4
2014-08-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed old code and fixed a typo that introduced a double-free bug.

2014-08-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	changes that parallel ones made on the h 1.9 release branch -
	simpler to make them in both places than go through the whole

2014-08-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I saw that the fileout JSON code does not need to use a temporary file so I modified the Transform objects to take a stram and, if supplied, write to it directly by passing the temporary file step. There were some changes in the Transmitters too, since that's where the temp file was being made.
