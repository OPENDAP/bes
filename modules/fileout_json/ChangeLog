	Hyrax 1.13.2
2016-09-08  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed hyrax 242 - responses with function calls in the CE
	I also refactored other aspects of the *Transform and *Transmitter
	classes so they are more compact and easier to use.

2016-09-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' into response_cache

2016-06-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hyrax 1.13.1

2016-05-11  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Dropped use of DataDDS in fvor of the DDS class.
2016-03-22  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Cleaning up code for merge.

2016-03-21  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Tests for function result promotion in transmitters. Test function wrapitup() added.

2016-03-18  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added support for the function result promotion (aka the '_unwrap') scheme.

2016-01-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated ChangeLog, etc., for the bes 3.17 release

2015-12-28  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Patched error handling problems in Transmitter implmentations. In particular: 
	1) Ensured that libdap::Error objects are converted to BESDapError objects when 
	caught. and 2) Catch and rethrow BESError objects whenever they could be thrown
	so they don't get swept up as unidentified errors in a catch(...) clause.
	
2015-10-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Update for bes 3.16.0 release
	
2015-10-01  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of
	changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and
	BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression
	cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache
	configuration collisions with various handlers that also were
	utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by
	calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir,
	BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we
	specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from
	the other caches.

2015-09-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes to Makefile.am in the autotest dirs; clean removes bes.conf

2015-09-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2015-09-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for issues found by Coverity

2015-09-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified because a fix in libdap broke this code
	libdap was setting the output stream precision and not
	resetting it. Whne I fixed that, this code had to be updated.

2015-09-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified Makefile.am to support distcheck

2015-08-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed package.m4 in the autoconf dirs Makefile.am files

2015-05-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Halfway to removing the tests' need for the netcdf handler.
	The dapreader handler still does not process Grids correctly...

	Repaired getopt() use. Patch from O. Poplawski.

2015-04-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/fileout_json

	Modified Makefile.am to support bes distcheck

2015-04-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Version 1.0.0
2015-03-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a problem with make check
	It failed when CppUnit was not present. Now those tests
	are ignored.

2015-03-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Accommodate autoconf 2.63
	Removed -j7 from TESTSUITEFLAGS. Can still pass them in from
	the command line (make check TESTSUITEFLAGS=-j7).

2015-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/fileout_json
	Conflicts:
		unit-tests/Makefile.am

	Modified Makefile.am for distcheck combined with the modules build of the BES

2015-03-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	misspelled name in a Makefile

2015-03-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Fixed bug in loop

2015-03-11  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Renamed FoJsonTransform* and FoJsonTransmitter* to
	FoInstanceJsonTransform* and FoInstanceJsonTransmitter*
	respectively to better reflect the classes actual functionality.
	Also added string escaping to all object names in the
	ijson (FoJsonTransmitter) output to protect from crazy variable
	names breaking the validitiy of the returned JSON content.

	Renamed FoW10nJson* to FoDapJson* to better represent the actual
	functionallity of the classes. Made the json 'type' properties
	match the DAP types os the associated variables. Fixed baselines
	and testing regalia.

	Renamed array functions in a more understandable manner.

	Added special method for arrays of strings. Tidied up use of std::
	for string, Debug statements, etc.

2015-03-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed an issue with libdap::Vector::value()
	Code in FoJsonTransform inadvertently built a call to a non-existent
	version of libdap::Vector:value. I specialized the
	json_simple_type_array() method as a work-around.

2015-02-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed error in test baseline
	The test baseline abstract_object_test_DATA.json.baseline
	used six escaped double quotes that are not in the output. I
	think the escaped double quotes was something that was an issue
	but which was fixed. I modified the baseline, so the test passes,
	by removing the extra (escaped) double quotes.

	Fixed namespace error
	The function escape_for_json in namespace fojson was
	declared as string function(string &) but defined as
	string function(const string &). Different type signatures
	== different functions. So the problem was not really a
	namespace issue at all.

2015-02-20  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Fixes to fojson to correctly escape strings, and support for arrays of sting and url

	Fixes to fojson to correctly escape strings, and support for arrays of sting and url

2015-02-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2015-02-02  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Repaired production rules so distclean works correctly.

2015-01-29  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	fileout_json: Removed copy-pasta cruft that incorrectly identified the project as fileout_netcdf

2015-01-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed dist-hook which as a hack for SVN

	Removed use of case libdap::dods_url4_c
	This type constant was removed from libdap.

2014-12-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/dap4'

2014-12-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Remove package.m4 from the repo

2014-12-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed configure.ac after the merge with the modules branch.

2014-12-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added module name and version info to Makefile.am
	This change was made to support the modules build where the autoconf
	symbols PACKAGE_NAME and _MODULE are defined by the bes configure
	script. This meant that the version response from the bes was useless
	since it listed every module as 'bes' and gave the bes' version
	number.

2014-11-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Build changes.
	Tweaked	the config.status dep so that it includes $(top_srcdir).
	Added the new bes.conf.modules.in to EXTRA_DIST	  in Makefile.am.

2014-11-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added bes.conf.modules.in
	Needed for the modules build.

2014-11-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added tmp using the .gitignore trick to add empty dirs

	Changes for the 'modules' build.

2014-09-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	A    https://scm.opendap.org/svn/branch/fileout_json/dap4
2014-08-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed old code and fixed a typo that introduced a double-free bug.

2014-08-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	changes that parallel ones made on the h 1.9 release branch -
	simpler to make them in both places than go through the whole

	I saw that the fileout JSON code does not need to use a temporary file so I modified the Transform objects to take a stram and, if supplied, write to it directly by passing the temporary file step. There were some changes in the Transmitters too, since that's where the temp file was being made.
