Many of the baseline in this directory use 'pattern' matches via grep.

The baselines are cea.tif.0.bescmd.baseline, cea.tif.2.bescmd.baseline,
cea.tif.r0.bescmd, cea.tif.r2.bescmd, and cea.tif.dmr.bescmd.

The pattern is really very minor - when we switched to GDAL 2.1, one
float value in the spatial_ref attribute was different in its last 
four digits. I replaced the fractional part with '.*' as in:

git diff truncated with the changes highlighted:

- String spatial_ref " ... ,SPHEROID[\"Clarke 1866\",6378206.4,294.9786982139006, ...
+ String spatial_ref " ... ,SPHEROID[\"Clarke 1866\",6378206.4,294..*, ...

You can see which tests use the pattern by looking in the testsuite.at file
and looking for the macro AT_BESCMD_REPEAT_RESPONSE_PATTERN_TEST.
