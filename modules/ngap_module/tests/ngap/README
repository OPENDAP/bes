These tests work three scenarios:
1. The DMR++ is in the OPeNDAP S3 bucket and it should be used (because the bes.conf option says so).
2. The DMR++ is in the OPeNDAP S3 bucket but it should not be used (because the bes.conf option says so).
   In that case, the DMR++ is found by going to the DAAC bucket
3. The DMR++ is not in the OPeNDAP S3 bucket and but it is in the DAAC bucket and that should be used.

I used two testsuite.at files, but we might want to combine them into one by adding the bes.conf
file to some of the test macros (or adding a new macro or two).

These tests require the the CM.config file (not in GitHub) is set with credentials for both the
OPeNDAP S3 bucket and NGAP. The latter uses an EDL token that is only used when the code is built
in developer mode.
