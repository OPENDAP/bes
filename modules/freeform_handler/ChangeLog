	Merge pull request #59 from OPENDAP/cache_fix
	Cache fix

	Clean up residual cache code. Add a note about fcntl(2) versus flock(2)
	Both fcntl(2) and flock(2) can be used for advisory locking. The
	BESFileLockingCache uses fcntl() and that impacts testing since
	all of our testing is single-process. Not a huge deal, but if we
	want more complete testing we'll need to change how we implement
	the locks or use multi-process testing.

	Modest fixes to the test code in cacheT

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/cacheT_fix' into cache_fix

	This code now builds and passes the tests we have...
	But we might ned or want to write more/better tests for the cache.

2017-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix to BESFSDir for the opendir/readdir race condition.
	When two processes are using the same directory and one process makes
	and deletes files in the directory at the same time as the other
	process uses opendir/readdir to iterate over the files in the
	directory, it's possible for file names to show up in entries returned
	by readdir that no longer exist (i.e., stat(2) returns -1). It's better
	to ignore this than signal an error (IMHO).

	Added ScaleUtilTest back into the build

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:/opendap/bes

	Removed errant tab in Makefile.am

	Fixed an error in both scale_util.cc and its test code (ScaleUtilTest.cc)
	In scale_util.cc:get_gcp_data() the code samples the data and uses
	both integer division and 'increment by sample factor' and those
	were producing an off by one error in some cases.

	Removed ScaleUtilTest from bes/functions for now.

	Fixed BesDebug --> BESDebug and removed some generated files.

	Ugh. Still recovering from geo-functions merge mess - removed generatged files
	... From gateway bes-testsuite

	Added bes-testsuite for w10n handler

	Added the bes-testsuite dir back in for the gateway handler

2017-03-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed all the unused lines from the pvolT BES keys file

	Patched the pvolT test so that it writes temp files to ./cache
	This keeps those temp files from conflicting with the BESKeys use of
	a regex in the BES.Include line in one of it's test files. This is not
	a real fix for the problem, which will take a bit more time - and an
	understanding of the BES File and Dir classes...

	Fixed the various badness of my previous merge of geo-functions.

	OK. Added the gateway and w10n handlers back in.

2017-03-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added comment to ContainerStorageVolatile about needing BESKeys file

	pvolT now uses separate tests.
	I'm not sure this really addresses the underlying issue with the pvolT
	and keysT conflict, but is makes the test cleaner and might help debug
	the issue.

	Added options to unit-tests keysT and pvolT

2017-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Unit tests in dispatch fail when run in parallel. This is a fix.
	The setup() code in pvolT seems to conflict with the code in keysT
	when keysT starts and then pvolT starts and finishes before keysT
	finishes. I have no idea why, but the text in the pvolT's setup()
	shows up in keysT. It turns out that the setup() code is not needed,
	and removing it seems to fix the problem. Seems to...

	Fixes for issues found by Coverity

2015-09-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for some memory issues

2015-09-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified Makefile.am to support distcheck

2015-09-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Formatting

2015-09-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The Makefile.am was broken and thus not running the tests

2015-08-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed package.m4 in the autoconf dirs Makefile.am files

2015-04-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/freeform_handler

	Modified Makefile.am to support bes distcheck

2015-04-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Version 3.9.0
2015-03-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added to gitignore

2015-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for distclean and the modules build.
	I had to move the generation of the bes.conf file back to the
	Makefile and use an automake conditional to build different
	bes.conf files for the modules and standard builds.

2015-02-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	RequestHandler instrumentation.
	Especially useful for multi-container debugging, but also
	general in applicability.

2015-01-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed dist-hook which as a hack for SVN

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/dap4'
	Conflicts:
		bes-testsuite/Makefile.am

2014-12-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed Makefile.am and configure.ac after merging with the modules branch.

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/modules'

2014-12-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added module name and version info to Makefile.am
	This change was made to support the modules build where the autoconf
	symbols PACKAGE_NAME and _MODULE are defined by the bes configure
	script. This meant that the version response from the bes was useless
	since it listed every module as 'bes' and gave the bes' version
	number.

2014-12-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated	the spec file to release 2.

2014-12-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Build changes.
	Tweaked the config.status dep so that it includes $(top_srcdir).
	Added the new bes.conf.modules.in to EXTRA_DIST   in Makefile.am.

2014-11-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed bes.conf.modules.in from gitignore

	Added bes.conf.modules.in - part of the modules build.

	Added support for the modules build.

2014-09-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified the code in FFSequence so that it uses the transform_to_dap4() in Constructor.

2014-08-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for xml:base

2014-08-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Support for the new methods in libdap used to build the DDX using

	correctly formed DAS objects override the default methods in

	NB: The HDF5 handler seems to be broken WRT the DDX, both with

	The freeform library is now a 'convenience'

	for distcheck on OS/X and also more closely matches how the

	It just seem right to save things at this point. Most of the configure.ac files have been updated. The libdap software has had a number of the FILE* methods/functions commented out using #if FILE_METHODS and then #undef FILE_METHODS. We'll see how much of the redundant code can be removed before the next Hyrax 1.6 release.

2008-10-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Ticket 1188: can not --> cannot. This was for the a handful
	of error messages, but I wound up changing it everywhere since
	that was easier.

2008-10-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed some unused *.cc files. Modified the Makefile.am.

2008-10-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More reformatting...

	DODS_Time_Factory.cc

2008-10-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	removed code that has been commented out. Reformatted some files
	that were looking esp. ragged.

2008-10-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for ticket #985. The function find_ancillary_file() was
	poorly named since that name was already taken by another function
	in libdap and since that's not what this function did at all! I
	found that the same information could be stored in the FFArray and
	FFSequence variables when they are built and then used later to
	read data values. Thus the function is no longer used and is
	commented out. I'll remove it in a subsequent check in.

2008-10-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added note to README regarding a neat FreeForm feature unearthed
	by Denis Nadeau. (Ticket 919)

	More change for ticket 764 (install test data and configure the
	handler in the bes). I made a shell script that modifies the
	bes.conf, testing to see if it has already been run first. I've
	modified the Makefile.am to build the script and install it in
	$prefix/bin when the bes is present. The .spec file has also been
	modified, although I have not done a complete test because that
	requires the bes rpm package be installed first.

	FFRequestHandler.cc: Fix for ticket 752. Files could not be read
	because I goofed when adding support for ancillary DAS files. The
	code added dis not test for the case where a file is not found.
	Now it does.

2006-12-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Lots of changes for a simple fix to ticket 730. The static object
	pointer in ff_ce_functions.cc:get_instance() worked only for the
	first call of the handler. I removed the static object pointer and
	streamlined the way factory classes were used. This meant changing
	the calling parameters for every factory in the date/time functions.
	I also changed the code so that the DDS is always loaded with
	attributes so the hack used to read in the DAS is now gone.

2006-12-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ChangeLog checkpoint

2006-12-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ff_handler.cc: Made the DDS and DataDDS returns use a 'fully
	loaded' DDS (one with attribtues) just like the DDX return.
	FFRequestHandler.cc: The DDS and DataDDS responses now use
	a fully loaded DDS. These changes mean that server side functions
	which depend on attributes will now work.

2006-12-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	FFRequestHandler.cc: Fix for ticekt #720: The DDS and DataDDS
	type factories were being deleted and then the CE was being
	evaluated; this breaks when the CE contains a constant since
	the factory is used to make a variable to hold the constant's
	value. I removed the delete calls and add code to the BES to
	handle the clean up of the DDS/Factory.

2006-12-04  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Three global variables are used to read data in Free Form handler.
	In the cgi version the code is run once and only once, but in the
	BES one server can handle multiple requests for data, for ascii,
	etc... So, these three global variables must be reset each time a
	read is done on the data.

	ConstraintEvaluator is now a part of the BESDDSResponse and
	BESDataDDSResponse classes instead of BESDataHandlerInterface. Any Error
	exceptions need to be caught in the request handlers and converted into
	BESHandlerException, which is the non-fatal exception.
	M    freeform_handler/FFRequestHandler.cc

2006-09-27  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	--without-bes now works for the different handler directories as well as for
	the dap-server directory. cedar-handler requires bes. If --without-bes is
	not specified then either --with-bes is looked at if specified, or the
	bes-config script is looked for.

2006-08-24  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Renamed ce_functions to ff_ce_functions because there is already a

	libdap iostreams methods (which have been removed from libdap).

2006-01-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed set_mime-test() in ff_handler.cc so that it uses stdout
	and not cout. I removed the iostreams versions of the
	set_mime...() function from libdap in version 3.6.

2005-10-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added version numbers.

	Added a spec file for RPMs

2005-09-16  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed errors that showed up in the tests. Spaces were not being
	removed from string values (which was fixed in 3.4 but must not
	have been merged back to the trunk) and tests with error responses
	used the wrong text for comparison
	(not really a bug...).

2005-09-16  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for the dejagnu testsuite.

2005-07-05  Rob Morris <Robert.O.Morris@jpl.nasa.gov>

	Set eol-style to native on all text file in the trunk

2004-07-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merged with release-3-4-3FCS.

2004-07-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	07/09/04 jhrg

2004-07-09  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-4-3FCS.

2004-02-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-4-2FCS.

2004-02-16  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

        * Updated to remove '-gstabs' for 'alpha' platform computers.
	(dan)

2003-02-10    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-5.

2002-07-08    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* util_ff.cc (get_integer_value, get_float_value): Fix for bug
	471. I goofed on 2002-01-21 when I `fixed' bug 62; that fix is now
	fixed... 

2002-04-04    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* ffdas.cc (get_attributes): Added add_variable_containers as a
	fix for bug 284. Updated relevant tests in ff-test.

2002-01-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* It is now possible to set up DODS File Servers using types other
	than int32 for the date and time components. While this is not a
	particularly big deal, users won't be told that int16 isn't
	allowed when all they want is a number that runs from 0 to 59. See
	Bug 62.

2001-10-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-4.

	* Fixed some minor problems with the configure script.

	* Removed some unused code.

	* Fixed a bug in the Date and Time factory classes where the field
	_gmt was shadowed by a local variable with the same name.

	* Updated README & INSTALL.

2001-09-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged 3.2.3. The next merge should use release-3-2-3 -j
	release-3-2.

2001-09-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed error reporting bugs (Reza).

	* Added some rudimentary error checking to the date and time
	server side functions.

2001-06-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged head of release-3-2 (tagged release-3-2-2). The next
	merge should use update -j release-3-2-2 -j release-3-2.

	* Factored out the code in read_attributes that extracts
	attributes from data file headers. I also added error trapping so
	that files without headers won't crash the server(!). Also, I
	modified the code which adds the attributes to quote any multiword
	String attributes (using space, \r and \t as separators).

	* Removed calls to find_ancillary_files to locate format
	descriptor files. Use the functions in the FreeForm code to
	perform this function (which happens anyways).

	* Added throw for dates with months outside of 1 through 12.

	* Fixed the DAS tests. They match the new DAS objects which lack the
	long string and which contain datafile header info.

	* Changed the way the DODSFilter is used to support the new
	version request which returns information about the server's
	version (name and number) along with information about the core
	software's version.

	* Changed NULL to 0 in an assignment to _year_base (which is an
	int) because of a g++ warning.

	* Modified date server-side functions to support year/month date
	representations, and to support ISO8601 output formats. (By Dan).
	
	* Merged with changes on the release-3-1 branch. This apparently
	was not done corrrectly the first time around.

2001-01-29  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Made sure that multiword String attributes are quoted.

	* Fixed a bug in the code that reads datafile headers and dumps
	them into the DAS; Files without a header crashed the server.

2000-08-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-1-7. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-1-7 -j release-3-1.

	* Merged with Dan's fix for ISO8601 time specs in DODS_Time.cc
	[This happened over onthe release-3-1 branch since the fix wound
	here on the trunk first. I merged it onto the release-3-1 branch
	so I could make a release without getting into the 3.2 code jhrg]

	* Removed all mention of config_dap.h

2000-08-03  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Tagged this code 3-1-6.

	* Fixed a bug in the test code which made all the tests fail when
	the CWD (.) was not in PATH.

	* Removed use of the config_dap.h header; used config_ff.h in its
	place. 

	* Fixed leap year calculations and condensed then to a pair of
	functions defined in date_proc.c. 

2000-05-01  Daniel Holloway  <dholloway@gso.uri.edu>

	* Added general server-side functions to support
	date-range inventory time variables.
	
2000-04-20  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Changed the FreeForm datatype assigned to dods_byte from int8 to
	uint8. This fixes problems in some datasets. I think, however,
	that FF should be lacks in testing values to see if they fit into
	a byte datatype.

1999-11-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged: cvs update -j release-3-1-2 -j release-3-1, the next
	merge should use -j release-3-1-3 -j release-3-1.

	* Updated the Makefile & configure script. Generic (non-Gnu) make
	utilities should work (although there may still be some rough
	spots). 

1999-08-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a string manipulation error that caused some multi-array
	dataset to return corrupted values.

	* Fixed handling of attributes for files without headers.

	* Changes so that ancillary DAS files use the same naming
	convention as format files.

1999-08-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* This server now reads headers and loads the variables defined
	into the DAS.

1999-05-25  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed the spelling of COPYRIGHT and removed dead code.

	* Added security fixes to the nph-ff.in script.

	* Added the decimal year server-side function.

1999-05-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added test-coverage target to Makefile.in

1999-05-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added version.h based version to dispatch script (set by
	configure).

	* Now uses the 3.0 DAP

	* Switched to the stdc++ string class. 

1999-03-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added support for the Int16, UInt16 and Float32 datatypes.

1999-03-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Format file are now found using a matching scheme that works
	when the filename has dots (.) in it.

1999-02-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* The four FreeForm tools newform, bufform, chkform and readfile
	are now built and installing (in DODS.bin) by default.

1999-02-24  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Generalized the tests so that they work regardless of the server
	version string. Really, this is a fix...

	* Updated to a new version of the FFND library. This version fixes
	the (in)famous stride bug.

1999-01-20  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Updated to a new revision of the FFND library from Mark O. This
	fixes a bug where several int32 fields and one text field in the
	format file would cause server problems. The server would either
	crash or return all zeros and null strings.

1999-01-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Updated the FFND library; Mark O. Made changes and I also made a
	few (minor) changes based on some warnings from gcc.

	* Added tests for the the basic actions of the server plus for the
	DODS_Date, _Time and _Date_time classes and the CE functions that
	provide access to them via CEs. 

1999-01-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Additions for the File Server. This software consists of the
	classes DODS_Date, DODS_Time, and DODS_Date_Time. Instances of
	these classes maybe created using the matching Factory classes
	which in turn read configuration parameters from an ancillary DAS
	object. The objects may be accessed via the CE using functions
	(see the files ce_functions.cc/h).

1998-11-12  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* This code contains an alpha version of the DODS_Date catlaog
	service code.

	* Fixed a problem in DODS_Date where using (mixing) String and
	string caused odd behavior --- extra characters were added to
	strings in odd ways. I removed, for the time being, string from
	the code using the preprocessor (see DODS_Date.h).

	* MAO Found and fixed a bug in sdbin (in the FFND code) that was
	causing the buffer-based FF accesses to fail. The jplpath.dat file
	in ff-tests now works correctly.

1998-09-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed many bugs.

	* Added a date() CE function. It is a collection of functions,
	waiting to become an object...
