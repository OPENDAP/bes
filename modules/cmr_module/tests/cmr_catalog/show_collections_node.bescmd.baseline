                <description>The Scripps Institution of Oceanography heat storage climatology was
derived from the NODC Global Ocean Temperature/Salinity data set
(1955-1988) and the Global Temperature/Salinity Pilot Project (GTSPP)
data set (1989-1994). Temperatures were interpolated at 15 standard
levels from 0 to 800 meters. The climatological series was based on
the January 1980-December 1989 data.

                <description>These data sets consist of locations of global occurrences of
volcanoes and earthquakes. Each data set contains the latitude
and longitude of the event. The earthquake data sets contains
the magnitude of the earthquake and depth. The volcano data set
contains the name of the volcano. An interactive map is
available to view the information contained in the data sets.</description>

                <description>This gridded data set is constructed as described by Reverdin et al. (1994)
from current data during the period 1987 to April 1992. Drifts of more than
1000 surface buoys were merged with currents from current-meter moorings at 5
sites (4 along the equator at 165E, 170W, 140W and 110W and one at 6N, 140W).
The drifters were initially drogued by a sea anchor of various designs centered
at 15 meters. The proportion of drifters with drogue present is large near the
equator (more than 80%), but diminish to roughly 50% near 20N and 20S.
Corrections were not made for drogue loss, and the systematic error on the 15m
currents can therefore exceed 5 cm/s near 20N and 20S.</description>
