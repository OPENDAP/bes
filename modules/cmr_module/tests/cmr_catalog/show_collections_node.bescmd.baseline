                <description>The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.

Version 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.

This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  Late Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDL) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHL. The derived result represents a Late expedited estimate of the daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHHL and giving the result in (mm). The latency of the derived late daily product is a couple of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHL for the UTC data day is received at GES DISC. Since the target latency of GPM_3IMERGHHL is 12 hours, the daily should appear about 12 hours after the closure of the UTC day. For information on the original data (GPM_3IMERGHHL), please see the Documentation (Related URL).  

In the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.

The half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.

The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the &#8220;forecast&#8221; and the IR estimates as the &#8220;observations&#8221;, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.

The IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:

&quot;Early&quot; multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and
&quot;Late&quot; multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing
and once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:

&quot;Final&quot;, satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.

Currently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.


The following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.

The daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                

Pdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]
Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}

where:
Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)
Pi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)
Nf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=48
1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise
Pdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.

Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.
Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.


On occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the &quot;true&quot; daily total. These events are easily detectable using &quot;counts&quot; variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which
 Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.


There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:

Perr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]
Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )

where:
Perr_daily	- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)
Ncnt_err	- The counts for the error variable

Thus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:

rms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5	(mm/hr)


This estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.

Precipitation phase is computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. The current period of record is June 2000 to the present (delayed by about 3.5 months).

                <description>The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.</description>

This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Final* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH. The derived result represents the final estimate of the Daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHH and giving the result in (mm). 

The latency of the derived *Final* Daily product depends on the delivery of the IMERG *Final* Half-Hourly product GPM_IMERGHH. Since the latter are delivered in a batch, once per month for the entire month, with 2-3 months latency, so will be the latency for the Final Daily, plus about 24 hours. Thus, e.g. the Dailies for January  can be expected to appear no earlier than April 2.

The following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.

The daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                

Pdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]
Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}

where:
Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)
Pi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)
Nf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=48
1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise
Pdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.

Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.
Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.


On occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the &quot;true&quot; daily total. These events are easily detectable using &quot;counts&quot; variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which
 Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.


There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:

Perr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]
Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )

where:
Perr_daily	- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)
Ncnt_err	- The counts for the error variable

Thus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:

rms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5	(mm/hr)


This estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.

                <description>The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.

Minor Version 06B is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06B.

The precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.

The half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme. 
The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the &#8220;forecast&#8221; and the IR estimates as the &#8220;observations&#8221;, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.

The IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:

&quot;Early&quot; multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and
&quot;Late&quot; multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing
and once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:

&quot;Final&quot;, satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.

Currently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.

Briefly describing the Late Run, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the CORRA product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot TRMM/GPM estimate after adjustment to the monthly GPCP SG), then &quot;forward/backward morphed&quot; and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields to provide half-hourly precipitation estimates on a 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) grid over the globe. Precipitation phase is computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. The current period of record is June 2000 to the present (delayed by about 14 hours).

                <description>NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are &quot;open-loop&quot; (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.

GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.

This data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly 0.25 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.

The 3-hourly data product was simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.

The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.

In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask. Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values. The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README. The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.

If you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.

GLDAS-2.2 is new to the GES DISC archive and currently includes a main product from CLSM-F2.5 with Data Assimilation for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE-DA) from February 2003 to present.  The GLDAS-2.2 data are available in two production streams: one with GRACE data assimilation outputs (the main production stream), and one without GRACE-DA (the early production stream).  Since the GRACE data have a 2-6 month latency, the GLDAS-2.2 data are first created without GRACE-DA, and are designated as the Early Product (EP), with about 1 month latency.  Once the GRACE data become available, the GLDAS-2.2 data are processed with GRACE-DA in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Product archive.  

The GLDAS-2.2 GRACE-DA product was simulated with Catchment-F2.5 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data product contains 24 land surface fields from February 1, 2003 to present.

The simulation started on February 1, 2003 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 Daily Catchment model simulation, forced with the meteorological analysis fields from the operational European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System.  The total terrestrial water anomaly observation from GRACE satellite was assimilated (Li et al, 2019). Due to the data agreement with ECMWF, this GLDAS-2.2 daily product does not include the meteorological forcing fields.

The GLDAS-2.2 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.</description>

                <description>This TRMM Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) Level 1B Calibrated Radiance Product (1B01) contains calibrated radiances and auxiliary geolocation information from the five channels of the VIRS instrument, for each pixel of each scan. The data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), which includes both core and product specific metadata applicable to the VIRS measurements. A file contains a single orbit of data with a file size of about 95 MB. The EOSDIS &quot;swath&quot; structure is used to accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays. There are 16 files of VIRS 1B01 data produced per day.

For channels 1 and 2, Level 1B radiances are derived from the Level 1A (1A01) sensor counts by computing calibration parameters (gain and offset) derived from the counts registered during space and solar and/or lunar views. New calibration parameters are produced every one to four weeks. Channels 3, 4, and 5 are calibrated using the internal blackbody and the space view. These calibration parameters, together with a quadratic term determined pre-launch, are used to generate a counts vs. radiance curve for each band, which is then used to convert the earth-view pixel counts to spectral radiances.

Geolocation and channel data are written out for each pixel along the scan, whereas the time stamp, scan status (containing scan quality information), navigation, calibration coefficients, and solar/satellite geometry are specified on a per-scan basis. There are in general 18026 scans along the orbit pre-boost and 18223 post-boost, with each scan consisting of 261 pixels. The scan width is about 720 km pre-boost and 833 km post-boost.

Changes in horizontal resolution resulting from the TRMM boost that occurred on 24 August 2001:

Pre-Boost (before 7 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 91.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 720 km; Horizontal Resolution: 2.2 km

  This dataset contains TRMM Micrwave Imager (TMI) L1B calibrated radiances in terms of Brightness Temperatures.

The TMI calibration algorithm (1B11) converts the radiometer counts to antenna temperatures by applying a linear relationship of the form Ta = c1 + c2 x count. The coefficients are provided by the instrument contractor. Antenna temperatures are corrected for cross-polarization and spill over to produce brightness temperatures (Tb), but no antenna beam pattern correction or sample to pixel averaging are performed. Temperatures are provided at 104 scan positions for the low frequency channels and 208 scan positions at 85 GHz. There are four samples per pixel (3 -dB beamwidth) at 10 GHz, two samples at 19, 22, and 37 GHz, and one sample per pixel for the 85 GHz.

                <description>The TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), the first of its kind in space, is an electronically scanning radar, operating at 13.8 GHz that measures the 3-D rainfall distribution over both land and ocean, and defines  the layer depth of the precipitation.
                                          
The 1B21 calculates the received power at the PR receiver input point from the Level-0 count value which is linearly proportional to the logarithm of the PR receiver output power. To convert the count value to the input power, extensive internal calibrations are applied, which are mainly based upon the system model, temperature dependence of model parameters and many temperature sensors attached at various locations of the PR. Periodically the input-output characteristics are measured using an internal calibration loop for the IF unit and later receiver stages. To make an absolute calibration, an Active Radar Calibrator (ARC) is placed at Kansai Branch of CRL and overall system gain of the PR is being measured every 2 months.  Using the transfer function based on the above internal and external calibrations, the PR received power is obtained. Note that the value assumes that the signal follows the Rayleigh fading, so if the fading characteristics of a scatter is different, a small bias error may occur (within 1 or 2 dB).

The 1C21 calculates the effective radar reflectivity factor at 13.8 GHz without any propagation loss (due to rain or any other atmospheric gas) correction (Zm). Therefore, the Zm value can be calculated just by applying a radar equation for volume scatter with PR system parameters. The noise-equivalent Zm is about 21 dBZ. Through the subtraction of the system noise, the Zm value as small as 16 or 18 dBZ are still usable although the data quality is marginal.  In 1C21, all echoes stored in 1B21 are converted to &quot;dBZ&quot; unit. This is not relevant for &quot;non-rain&quot; echo; however, this policy is adopted so that the 1B21 and 1C21 product format should be as close as possible except for the following points:                                         
- Radar quantity is Zm in dBZ unit instead of received power (dBm).
- Data at echo-free range bins judged in 1B21 are replaced with a dummy value.

                <description>TMPA (3B42_Daily) dataset have been discontinued as of Dec. 31, 2019, and users are strongly encouraged to shift to the successor IMERG dataset (doi: 10.5067/GPM/IMERGDF/DAY/06).

This daily accumulated precipitation product is generated from the research-quality 3-hourly TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis TMPA (3B42). It is produced at the NASA GES DISC, as a value added product.  Simple summation of valid retrievals in a grid cell is applied for the data day. The result is given in (mm). The beginning and ending time for every daily granule are listed in the file global attributes, and are taken correspondingly from the first and the last 3-hourly granules participating in the aggregation. Thus the time period covered by one daily granule amounts to 24 hours, which can be inspected in the file global attributes. 

Counts of valid retrievals for the day are provided for every variable, making it possible to compute conditional and unconditional mean precipitation for grid cells where less than 8 retrievals for the day are available.

Efforts have been made to make the format of this  derived product as similar as possible to the new Global Precipitation Measurement CF-compliant file format.

The information provided here on the TRMM mission, and on the original 3-hr 3B42 product, remain relevant for this derived product. Note, however, this product is in netCDF-4 format.



The following describes the derivation in more details.

The daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 3-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 3 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                

Pdaily     = 3 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]
Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}

where:
Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)
Pi              - 3-hourly input, in (mm/hr)
Nf              - Number of 3-hourly files per day, Nf=8
1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise
Pdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.

Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.
Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.


On occasion, the 3-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the &quot;true&quot; daily total. These events are easily detectable using &quot;counts&quot; variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which
 Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.


There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 3-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 3-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 3 is finally applied:

Perr_daily = 3 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]
Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )

where:
Perr_daily	- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)
Ncnt_err	- The counts for the error variable

Thus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 3-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, accumulates first within the 3-hour period of the source data, and then continues to accumulate during the day. These values, however, can easily be converted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:

rms_err =   { (Perr_daily/3) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5	(mm/hr)


This estimate assumes that the error given in the 3-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 3-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.

                <description>The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South at 1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North at 1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary).

                <description>The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Only Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered.

                <description>This dataset contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah 3.6.1 model in the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS).  The data are in 0.10 degree resolution and range from January 1982 to present. The temporal resolution is monthly and the spatial coverage is global (60S, 180W, 90N, 180E).  The FLDAS regional monthly datasets will no longer be available and have been superseded by the global monthly dataset. 

The simulation was forced by a combination of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) data and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) 6-hourly rainfall data that has been downscaled using the NASA Land Data Toolkit.

The simulation was initialized on January 1, 1982 using soil moisture and other state fields from a FLDAS/Noah model climatology for that day of the year.

In November 2020, all FLDAS data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information on this can be found in the FLDAS README document, and the MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the FLDAS Project site.  If you had downloaded any FLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data. </description>

                <description>NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are &quot;open-loop&quot; (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.

GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  

This data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is GLDAS-2.1 Noah monthly 0.25 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version. 

The monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.

The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency&amp;#8217;s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.

In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.

                <description>The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.

Version 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.

This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Early* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDE) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHE. The derived result represents an early (expedited) estimate of the daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHHE and giving the result in (mm). The latency of the derived Early daily product is a couple of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHE for the UTC data day is received at GES DISC. Since the target latency of GPM_3IMERGHHE is 4 hours, the daily should appear about 4 hours after the closure of the UTC day. For information on the original data (GPM_3IMERGHHE), please see the Documentation (Related URL). 

In the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.

The half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.

The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the &#8220;forecast&#8221; and the IR estimates as the &#8220;observations&#8221;, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.

The IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:

&quot;Early&quot; multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and
&quot;Late&quot; multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing
and once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:

&quot;Final&quot;, satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.

Currently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.


The following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.

The daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                
Pdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]
Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}

where:
Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)
Pi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)
Nf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=48
1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise
Pdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.

Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.
Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.


On occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the &quot;true&quot; daily total. These events are easily detectable using &quot;counts&quot; variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which
 Pdaily_cnt less than  Nf.


There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:

Perr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]
Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )

where:
Perr_daily	- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)
Ncnt_err	- The counts for the error variable

Thus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:

rms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5	(mm/hr)


This estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.

In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.

Briefly describing the Early Run, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the CORRA product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot TRMM/GPM estimate after adjustment to the monthly GPCP SG), then &quot;forward morphed&quot; and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields to provide half-hourly precipitation estimates on a 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) grid over the globe. Precipitation phase is computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. The current period of record is June 2000 to the present (delayed by about 4 hours).

Nitrogen dioxide is an important chemical species in both, the stratosphere where it plays a key role in ozone chemistry, and in the troposphere where it is a precursor to ozone production. In the troposphere, it is produced in various combustion processes and in lightning and is an indicator of poor air quality.

The OMNO2d data are stored in version 5 EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of the orbit (~14 orbits). The average file size for the OMNO2d data product is about 12 Mbytes.</description>

                <description>TMPA (3B42RT_Daily) dataset have been discontinued as of Dec. 31, 2019, and users are strongly encouraged to shift to the successor IMERG dataset (doi: 10.5067/GPM/IMERGDE/DAY/06; 10.5067/GPM/IMERGDL/DAY/06).

This daily accumulated precipitation product is generated from the Near Real-Time  3-hourly TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis TMPA (3B42RT). It is produced at the NASA GES DISC, as a value added product.  Simple summation of valid retrievals in a grid cell is applied for the data day. The result is given in (mm). Although the grid is from 60S to 60N, the high latitudes (beyond 50S/N) near real-time retrievals are considered very unreliable and thus are screened out from the daily accumulations. The beginning and ending time for every daily granule are listed in the file global attributes, and are taken correspondingly from the first and the last 3-hourly granules participating in the aggregation. Thus the time period covered by one daily granule amounts to 24 hours, which can be inspected in the file global attributes.  

Counts of valid retrievals for the day are provided for every variable, making it possible to compute conditional and unconditional mean precipitation for grid cells where less than 8 retrievals for the day are available.

Efforts have been made to make the format of this  derived product as similar as possible to the new Global Precipitation Measurement CF-compliant file format. 

The latency of this derived daily product is about 7 hours after the UTC day is closed. Users should be mindful that the price for the short latency of these data is the reduced quality as compared to the research quality product.

The information provided here on the TRMM mission, and on the original 3-hr 3B42 product, remain relevant for this derived product. Note, however, this product is in netCDF-4 format.



The following describes the derivation in more details.

The daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 3-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 3 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                

Pdaily     = 3 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]
Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}

where:
Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)
Pi              - 3-hourly input, in (mm/hr)
Nf              - Number of 3-hourly files per day, Nf=8
1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise
Pdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.

Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.
Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.


On occasion, the 3-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the &quot;true&quot; daily total. These events are easily detectable using &quot;counts&quot; variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which
 Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.


There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 3-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 3-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 3 is finally applied:

Perr_daily = 3 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]
Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )

where:
Perr_daily	- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)
Ncnt_err	- The counts for the error variable

Thus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 3-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 3-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:

rms_err =   { (Perr_daily/3) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5	(mm/hr)


This estimate assumes that the error given in the 3-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 3-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.

                <description>This is the new (GPM-formated) TRMM product. It replaces the old TRMM_1B21,1C21

 Version 05 is the current version of the data set. Previous versions have been superseded by Version 05.
The TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), the first of its kind in space, is an electronically scanning radar, operating at 13.8 GHz that measures the 3-D rainfall distribution over both land and ocean, and defines  the layer depth of the precipitation.
                                          
The 1B21 calculates the received power at the PR receiver input point from the Level-0 count value which is linearly proportional to the logarithm of the PR receiver output power. To convert the count value to the input power, extensive internal calibrations are applied, which are mainly based upon the system model, temperature dependence of model parameters and many temperature sensors attached at various locations of the PR. Periodically the input-output characteristics are measured using an internal calibration loop for the IF unit and later receiver stages. To make an absolute calibration, an Active Radar Calibrator (ARC) is placed at Kansai Branch of CRL and overall system gain of the PR is being measured every 2 months.  Using the transfer function based on the above internal and external calibrations, the PR received power is obtained. Note that the value assumes that the signal follows the Rayleigh fading, so if the fading characteristics of a scatter is different, a small bias error may occur (within 1 or 2 dB).

This dataset contains TRMM Micrwave Imager (TMI) L1B calibrated radiances in terms of Brightness Temperatures.

The TMI calibration algorithm (1B11) converts the radiometer counts to antenna temperatures by applying a linear relationship of the form Ta = c1 + c2 x count. The coefficients are provided by the instrument contractor. Antenna temperatures are corrected for cross-polarization and spill over to produce brightness temperatures (Tb), but no antenna beam pattern correction or sample to pixel averaging are performed. Temperatures are provided at 104 scan positions for the low frequency channels and 208 scan positions at 85 GHz. There are four samples per pixel (3 -dB beamwidth) at 10 GHz, two samples at 19, 22, and 37 GHz, and one sample per pixel for the 85 GHz.

 Version 05 is the current version of the data set. Previous versions have been superseded by Version 05.

This TRMM Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) Level 1B Calibrated Radiance Product (1B01) contains calibrated radiances and auxiliary geolocation information from the five channels of the VIRS instrument, for each pixel of each scan. The data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), which includes both core and product specific metadata applicable to the VIRS measurements. A file contains a single orbit of data with a file size of about 95 MB. The EOSDIS &quot;swath&quot; structure is used to accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays. There are 16 files of VIRS 1B01 data produced per day.

For channels 1 and 2, Level 1B radiances are derived from the Level 1A (1A01) sensor counts by computing calibration parameters (gain and offset) derived from the counts registered during space and solar and/or lunar views. New calibration parameters are produced every one to four weeks. Channels 3, 4, and 5 are calibrated using the internal blackbody and the space view. These calibration parameters, together with a quadratic term determined pre-launch, are used to generate a counts vs. radiance curve for each band, which is then used to convert the earth-view pixel counts to spectral radiances.

Geolocation and channel data are written out for each pixel along the scan, whereas the time stamp, scan status (containing scan quality information), navigation, calibration coefficients, and solar/satellite geometry are specified on a per-scan basis. There are in general 18026 scans along the orbit pre-boost and 18223 post-boost, with each scan consisting of 261 pixels. The scan width is about 720 km pre-boost and 833 km post-boost.

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. Cloud-Cleared Radiances contain calibrated, geolocated channel-by-channel AIRS infrared radiances (milliWatts/m2/cm-1/steradian) that would have been observed within each AMSU footprint if there were no clouds in the FOV and produced along with the AIRS Standard Product, as they are the radiances used to retrieve the Standard Product. Nevertheless, they are an order of magnitude larger in data volume than the remainder of the Standard Products and, many Standard Product users are expected to have little interest in the Cloud Cleared Radiance. For these reasons they are a separate output file, but like the Standard Product, are generated at all locations.

WARNING: On 2021/09/23 the EOS Aqua executed a Deep Space Maneuver (DSM). In the DSM, the spacecraft is turned such that the normal Earth field of regard is deep space.

The thermal impact of the DSM caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (SRF) of about 1% of the width of the SRF, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. This shift is reflected in the &#8220;spectral_freq&#8221; parameter (observed frequencies) in the L1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. The magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (BT) depends on the spectral gradient of each channel. Maximum BT shifts are approximately +- 0.5 K, although many channels experience far smaller BT shifts. Approximately 1803 channels have BT shifts of less than 0.1 K and 575 channels are now shifted in BT by more than 0.1 K, while 231 of these channels have BT shifts greater than 0.2 K.

Users of the L1b v5 product who are concerned that these shifts may impact their science investigations and applications are encouraged to switch to the AIRS L1c v6.7.4 product, which, among many other improvements, converts the spectra to a fixed frequency grid.          END OF WARNING.



The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Infrared (IR) level 1B data set contains AIRS calibrated and geolocated radiances in milliWatts/m^2/cm^-1/steradian for 2378 infrared channels in the 3.74 to 15.4 micron region of t he spectrum. The AIRS instrument is co-aligned with AMSU-A so that successive blocks of 3 x 3 AIRS footprints are contained within one AMSU-A footprint. The AIRIBRAD_005 products are stored in files (often referred to as &quot;granules&quot;) that contain 6 minutes of data, 90 footprints across track by 135 lines along track.</description>

This product is the AIRS mid-tropospheric Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Level 3 Daily Gridded Retrieval, from the AIRS instrument on board of Aqua satellite. It is daily gridded data, at 2.5x2 deg (lon)x(lat) grid cell size. The data is in mole fraction units (data x 10^6 =ppm in volume). This is a total tropospheric column property. The file format is HDF-EOS 2.12 corresponding to HDF4. This AIRS mid-tropospheric CO2 Level 3 daily Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts as well as the latitude and longitude arrays giving the centers of the grid boxes. Each file covers a 24-hour period. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the individual CO2 retrievals which fall within that grid box over the period. The mid-tropospheric CO2 retrievals have been averaged and binned into 2.5 x 2 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -60.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean.</description>

AIRS/Aqua Level 3 pentad quantization product is in physical units (AIRS Only). The quantization products (QP) are distributional summaries derived from the Level-2 standard retrieval products (of swath type) to provide a more comprehensive set of statistical summaries than the traditional means and standard deviation. The QP products combine the Level 2 standard data parameters over grid cells of 5 x 5 deg spatial extent for temporal periods of five days. Pentads always start on the 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st, and 26th days of the month and may contain as few as 3 days of data or as much as 6 days. They preserve the multivariate distributional features of the original data and so provide a compressed data set that more accurately describes the disparate atmospheric states that is in the original Level-2 swath data set. The geophysical parameters are: Air Temperature and Water Vapor profiles (11 levels/layers), Cloud fraction (vertical distribution).</description>

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South at 1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North at 1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. The value for each grid box is the sum of the values that fall within the 1x1 area divided by the number of points in the box. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts.

The simulation was forced primarily by Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) data.  A nine-year spin-up of the Asia-LIS system was performed to produce stable snow and soil conditions, and the resulting model states were compared with MODIS Maximum Snow Extent data for the spin-up period and adjusted to produce a climatological model state for 1 October. Next, the Asia-LIS model was run from 1 Oct 2000 - 30 Sep 2011, producing outputs once per day, and resetting the model states to the climatological state on 1 October of each year so that each hydrologic year begins with a consistent set of surface states.</description>

                <description>NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2. GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are &quot;open-loop&quot; (i.e., no data assimilation).

This data set, GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree daily, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Catchment Land Surface Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014.

The GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO&amp;#8217;s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.

In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables.

                <description>NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are &quot;open-loop&quot; (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.

GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. 

This data product is for GLDAS-2.1 Catchment monthly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 3-hourly data simulated with the Catchment-F2.5 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.  

The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.

In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables.

This data product, GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree 3-hourly, was reprocessed and replaced its previous data product on November 27, 2019.  The data product contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.

The GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).

2ADPR provides single- and dual-frequency-derived precipitation estimates from the Ku and Ka radars of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on the core GPM spacecraft. The output consists of three main classes of precipitation products: those derived from the Ku-band frequency over a wide swath (245 km), those derived from the Ka-band frequency over a narrow swath (125 km), and those derived from the dual-frequency data over the narrow swath. The Ka-band results are further divided into the standard and high-sensitivity estimates. In the standard sensitivity mode, the fields of view within the inner swath are matched to those of the Ku-band. Data from these matched-beam Ku- and Ka-band fields of view are used to derive the dual-frequency precipitation products. The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar instrument field of view (IFOV).</description>

                <description>These data originate from NOAA/NCEP.

The NOAA Climate Prediction Center/NCEP/NWS is making the data available originally in binary format, in a weekly rotating archive. The NASA GES DISC is acquiring the binary files as they become available, converts them into CF (Climate and Forecast) -convention compliant netCDF-4 format, and stores the product in a permanent archive. It has been the intention to extend the record back to TRMM epoch, and some data are available from 1998. However, currently, the continuous record starts from February, 2000.

The leading edge of data availability is delayed by about 24 hours from real-time to abide by international data exchange agreements between NOAA and EUMETSAT (the METEOSAT data providers).

The data contain  globally-merged (60S-60N) 4-km pixel-resolution IR brightness temperature data (equivalent blackbody temps), merged from the European, Japanese, and U.S. geostationary satellites over the period of record (GOES-8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16, METEOSAT-5/7/8/9/10, and GMS-5/MTSat-1R/2/Himawari-8).

The data have been corrected for &quot;zenith angle dependence&quot;, i.e. IR temperatures for locations far from satellite nadir are erroneously cold due to a combination of geometric effects and radiometric path extinction effects.  This correction allows for the merging of the IR data from the various geostationary satellites with greatly reduced discontinuities at their boundaries.  Some residual differences among the data exist since the IR channels aboard the various spacecraft have slightly different characteristics and no intercalibration among the sensors has been performed. NOAA are in the process of performing such an intercalibration, although this effect is considerably smaller than the zenith angle effects.


The NASA GES DISC is curating these data in a self-documenting, CF-compliant, netCDF-4 format, which allows a broad range of applications to access the data directly, without the need to cope with the original binary data format. In addition to the direct download of netCDF-4 data, the GES DISC provides data download in binary, ASCII, and netCDF-3 formats using the OPeNDAP interface. 


Similarities with the original
-----------------------------
As in the original binaries, every netCDF-4 file covers one hour, and contains two half-hourly grids, at 4-km grid cell resolution. 


Differences from the original
-----------------------------
1. The data in the netCDF-4 files are already converted to real (float) values of Brightness Temperatures in Kelvin. There is no need to further scale these data. The netCDF-4 format is machine-independent and users need not worry about the endian-ness of their machines. 

2. To meet the requirements of collection spatial metadata, the grid is re-ordered from the original and now goes from -180 (West) to 180 (East). It is also starting from -60 (South).

The data and time units are reflected in the corresponding &quot;units&quot; attributes, and grid dimensions are described by longitude (&quot;lon&quot;), latitude (&quot;lat&quot;) and &quot;time&quot; vectors. Thus, any CF-compliant tool should automatically understand the setup in the data files and the starting time for each half-hourly grid. Even without such tools, simple &quot;ncdump&quot; or &quot;h5dump&quot; command line tools will easily disclose the netCDF-4 files configuration.

                <description>The &quot;HIRDLS/Aura Level 2 Geophysical Parameters&quot; data product (HIRDLS2) contains an entire day's worth of Level-2 vertical profiles of O3, HNO3, H2O, CFC-11, CFC-12, N2O, NO2, N2O5, ClONO2, temperature, geopotential height, and aerosol extinction at 12.1 and 8.3 microns, as well as cloud top pressure. HIRDLS measured infrared emissions in 21 channels ranging from 6.12 to 17.76 microns in the upper troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere. Data are available for the ~3 year mission from January 29, 2005 until March 17, 2008. Observations of the Earth's atmosphere were only made from the far azimuth scan (away from sun side) resulting in limited data coverage from +80 to -64 degrees latitude. The useful vertical range of the data depends on the measured species, and are provided on 24 levels per decade of pressure corresponding to about 1 km vertical resolution. The current and final version of this product is 7. Of the original targeted species, only CH4 was not retrieved in this version.

The data are stored in the version 5 Hierarchical Data Format for the Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS5), which is an extension of the HDF5 format. Each file contains a single swath object with one day of data (measured species and species precision), geolocation fields (e.g. time, latitude, longitude, pressure), and swath attributes, along with file level metadata. Each file contains approximately 5600 profile scans.</description>

                <description>AMSR2/GCOM-W1 surface soil moisture (LPRM) L3 1 day 10 km x 10 km ascending V001 is a Level 3 (gridded) data set. Its land surface parameters, surface soil moisture, land surface (skin) temperature, and vegetation water content, are derived from passive microwave remote sensing data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). There are two files per day, one ascending (daytime) and one descending (nighttime), archived as two different products. This document is for the daytime product. The data set covers the period from May 2012, when the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission-1st Water GCOM-W1 satellite was launched, to the present.

The LPRM is based on a forward radiative transfer model to retrieve surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. The land surface temperature is derived separately from the AMSR2's Ka-band (36.5 GHz). A unique feature of this method is that it can be applied at any microwave frequency, making it very suitable to exploit all the available passive microwave data from various satellites.

                <description>The Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) contains a wealth of information that can be used for weather and climate studies. By combining the assimilation of observations with a frozen version of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS), a global analysis is produced at an hourly temporal resolution spanning from January 1980 through present (Gelaro et al., 2017). It can be difficult to parse through a multidecadal dataset such as MERRA-2 to evaluate the interannual variability of weather that occurs on a daily timescale, let alone determine the occurrence of an extreme weather event. This data collection provides climate statistics compute using MERRA-2 to assist in the analysis of extreme temperature and precipitation events and the accompanying the large scale meteorological patterns across a time period of over four decades.

                <description>The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.

An overview of NCA-LDAS and its capability for developing climate change indicators are provided in Jasinski et al. (2019).  Details on the data assimilation used in NCA-LDAS are described in Kumar et al. (2019).  Sample mean annual trends are provided in the NCA-LDAS V2.0 README document.

This NCA-LDAS version 2.0 data product was simulated for the continental United States for the satellite era from January 1979 to December 2016. The core of NCA-LDAS is the multivariate assimilation of past and current satellite based data records within the Noah Version 3.3 land-surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution using NASA's Land Information System (LIS; Kumar et al. 2006) software framework during the Earth observing satellite era. The temporal resolution is daily. NCA-LDAS V001 data will no longer be available and have been superseded by V2.0.

NCA-LDAS includes 42 variables including land-surface fluxes (e.g. precipitation, radiation and latent and sensible heat, etc.), stores (e.g. soil moisture and snow), states (e.g., surface temperature), and routing variables (e.g., runoff, streamflow, flooded area, etc.), driven by the atmospheric forcing data from North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2; Xia et al., 2012). NCA-LDAS builds upon NLDAS through the addition of multivariate assimilation of earth observations such as soil moisture (Kumar et al, 2014), snow (Liu et al, 2015; Kumar et al, 2015a) and irrigation (Ozdagon et al, 2010; Kumar et al, 2015b). The EDRs that have been assimilated into the NCA-LDAS include soil moisture and snow depth from principally microwave sensors including SMMR, SSM/I, AMSR-E, ASCAT, AMSR-2, SMOS, and SMAP, irrigation intensity estimates from MODIS, and snow covered area from MODIS and from the multisensor IMS snow product.</description>

                <description>This data set contains the primary forcing hourly data &quot;File A&quot; for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2).  The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly.  The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB data files).

The non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).  NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  Additionally, the fields of surface pressure, surface downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface specific humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical difference between the NARR and NLDAS fields of terrain height.  This vertical adjustment applies the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature.  The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003).

The surface downward shortwave radiation field in &quot;File A&quot; is a bias-corrected field wherein a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward shortwave radiation.  This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the hourly 1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived by Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in &quot;File A&quot; is that computed in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984).

The precipitation field in &quot;File A&quot; is not the NARR precipitation forcing, but is rather a product of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology.  The precipitation is temporally disaggregated into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation weights from either WSR-88D Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km CMORPH hourly precipitation analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on availability, in order).  The latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation.  The field in &quot;File A&quot; that gives the fraction of total precipitation that is convective is an estimate derived from the following two NARR precipitation fields (which are provided in &quot;File B&quot;): NARR total precipitation and NARR convective precipitation (the latter is less than or equal to the NARR total precipitation and can be zero). The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from NARR.

The hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two files, &quot;File A&quot; and &quot;File B&quot;. &quot;File A&quot; is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven meteorological forcing fields. Details about the generation of the NLDAS-2.0 forcing datasets can be found in Xia et al. (2012).

                <description>This data set contains fifty-two fields simulated from the Noah land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB format). 

The NLDAS-2 monthly Noah model data, containing fifty-two fields, were generated from the NLDAS-2 hourly Noah model data, as monthly accumulation for rainfall, snowfall, subsurface runoff, surface runoff, total evapotranspiration, snow melt, and monthly averages for other variables. The monthly period of each month is from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month, with the exception of the very first month in the data set (Jan 1979) which starts at 00Z 02 Jan 1979. Also for the first month (Jan 1979), because the variables listed as instantaneous in the README file do not have valid data exactly on 00Z 02 Jan 1979, and this one hour is not included in the average for this month only.

 The OCO-2 mission provides the highest quality space-based XCO2 retrievals to date.

This global gridded dataset is produced using a data assimilation technique commonly referred to as state estimation within the geophysical literature. Data assimilation synthesizes simulations and observations, adjusting the state of atmospheric constituents like CO2 to reflect observed values, thus gap-filling observations when and where they are unavailable based on previous observations and short transport simulations by GEOS. Compared to other methods, data assimilation has the advantage that it makes estimates based on our collective scientific understanding, notably of the Earth&#8217;s carbon cycle and atmospheric transport.

In early 2021, the OCO Team identified an issue with OCO-2 level 2 products processed since January 28, 2020. The Ancillary Geometric Product (AGAP) file, a static file used in OCO-2 Geolocation processing, was inadvertently replaced with an obsolete version. This AGAP file included a ~300 m pointing error. As a result, all OCO-2 Level 2, version 10r, data files for the period January 28 - December 31, 2020, were corrected and replaced. The replacement process was completed by the end of June, 2021. The significance of this error has been described in Kiel et al. (2019; doi:10.5194/amt-12-2241-2019).

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory -3 (OCO-3) was deployed to the International Space Station in May, 2019. It is technically a single instrument, almost identical to OCO-2.

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its buildup in the atmosphere.

OCO-3 incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO2 near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O2) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers. The three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated independently. 

Oxygen-A Band cloud screening algorithm is one of the primary cloud screening tools implemented in the operational OCO processing pipeline. The algorithm was introduced and applied to early GOSAT data  with further analysis performed on OCO-2 simulations.

The OCO ABO2 algorithm employs a fast Bayesian retrieval to estimate surface pressure and surface albedo from high resolution spectra of the molecular oxygen (O2) A-band, near 0.765 µm. The radiative transfer forward model (FM) assumes a clear-sky condition, i.e. Rayleigh scattering only, such that differences between the modeled and measured radiances are apparent when the measurement scene contains cloud or aerosol.

                <description>Starting from August 6th in 2019, Sentinel-5P TROPOMI along-track high spatial resolution (~5.5km at nadir) has been implemented.
For data before August 6th of 2019, please check S5P_L2__CH4____1 data collection.

The Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P or S5P) satellite mission is one of the European Space Agency's (ESA) new mission family - Sentinels, and it is a joint initiative between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the ESA. The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.

The retrieval algorithm for Sentinel-5P TROPOMI methane product is a physics based method that uses the Oxygen-A band (760 nm) and absorption bands in shortwave infrared spectrum. In Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI methane algorithm, the atmosphere forward model simulates the absorbing gas (oxygen, methane, water vapor, and carbon monoxide) optical properties, as well as aerosol optical properties with size distribution, refractive index, and number concentration. The inversion is performed based on the forward calculation, the measurement, and the prior information. Cloud filtering is critical in methane retrieval, S5P methane algorithm applies re-gridded Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) cloud mask data. Additional cloud filters based on S5P/TROPOMI measurements and the FRESCO apparent surface pressure will be applied when VIIRS cloud data are not available. Other current data filters in the retrieval algorithm include land-only pixels (excluding mountainous areas), spectrum intensity, solar zenith angle and instrument zenith angle. 

The S5P/TROPOMI methane retrieval is for non-time-critical (NTC) data stream only, and its main outputs include the column averaged dry air mixing ratio of methane, the random error, and the biased corrected dry air methane fraction data based on the retrieved surface albedo. 

Starting from orbit #12432 on March 7th of 2020, the S-NPP auxiliary cloud data source used in the methane product data processing has been transitioned from the VIIRS Cloud Mask (VCM) into the Enterprise Cloud Mask (ECM).

The data are stored in an enhanced netCDF-4 format.</description>

The retrieval algorithm for Sentinel-5P TROPOMI SO2 from ultraviolet spectral measurements is the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) method. The relevant information of absorption cross section, instrument characteristics, cloud cover, and geolocation are utilized to derive SO2 slant column density (SCD). A sensitive spectral window of 312 to 326 nm is set as the baseline for the slant column fit with another two spectral windows (325 to 335 nm, 360 to 390 nm) to account for the non-linear effects in those high column amount cases. The SCD is then corrected with the empirical offsets to the systematic biases. The air mass factor (AMF) Look-up table has been created with the LIDORT radiative transfer model. The outputs of the DOAS algorithm are SO2 vertical column density (VCD), SCD, AMF, the DOAS-type averaging kernels (AK), and error estimates.</description>

                <description>The new version of these data is in GPM-like format and can be found under the name GPM_2AGPROFTRMMTMI_CLIM.

This dataset, 2A12, &#8221;TMI Profiling&#8221;, generates surface rainfall and vertical hydrometeor profiles on a pixel by pixel basis from the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) brightness temperature data using the Goddard Profiling algorithm GPROF2010. Because the vertical information comes from a radiometer, it is not written out in independent vertical layers like the TRMM Precipitation Radar. Instead, the output is referenced to one of 100 typical structures for each hydrometeor or heating profile. These vertical structures are referenced as clusters in the output structure. Vertical hydrometeor profiles can be reconstructed to 28 layers by knowing the cluster number (i.e. shape) of the profile and a scale factor that is written for each pixel.

This product contains hydrometeor profiles of cloud liquid water, precipitation water, cloud ice water, precipitation ice, rainfall type, and latent heating in 28 atmospheric layers. 

Changes in horizontal resolution resulting from the TRMM boost that occurred on 24 August 2001:

Pre-Boost (before 7 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 91.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 760 km; Horizontal Resolution: 4.4 km 

Post-Boost (after 24 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 92.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 878 km; Horizontal Resolution: 5.1 km

                <description>TMPA (3B42RT) dataset have been discontinued as of Dec. 31, 2019, and users are strongly encouraged to shift to the successor IMERG datasets (doi: 10.5067/GPM/IMERG/3B-HH-E/06, 10.5067/GPM/IMERG/3B-HH-L/06).

These data were output from the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), the Near Real-Time (RT) processing stream.  The latency was about seven hours from the observation time, although processing issues may delay or prevent this schedule. Users should be mindful that the price for the short latency of these data is the reduced quality as compared to the research quality product.

Each file is a snapshot considered to represent the three-hour period centered on the &quot;nominal&quot; file time.  So, e.g., 00 UTC nominally represents the period from 2230 UTC of the previous day to 0130 UTC of the current day. Estimates outside the band 50 degree N-S are considered highly experimental. 

GES DISC initially receives these data from the Precipitation Processing System (PPS) in binary format.  However, before archiving, the data are scaled to real numbers, and re-arranged to a standard grid so that the first grid cell is at 180W, 60S. Thus formatted, data are stored  into CF-1.6 compliant netCDF-4 files and archived. This format is machine-independent, self-explanatory,  provides extremely efficient seamless compression, and gives various options for previewing the data without downloading it.

Apart from these technical differences, all other science content details remain the same, and users are strongly encouraged to read the provider's documentation that is linked to from here.</description>

                <description>Version 9r is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and are superseded by Version 9r.

This data set is currently provided by the OCO (Orbiting Carbon Observatory) Project. In expectation of the OCO-2 launch, the algorithm was developed by the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) Task as a preparatory project, using GOSAT TANSO-FTS spectra. After the OCO-2 launch,  &quot;ACOS&quot; data are still produced and improved, using approaches applied to the OCO-2 spectra.

The &quot;ACOS&quot; data set contains Carbon Dioxide (CO2) column averaged dry air mole fraction for all soundings for which retrieval was attempted. These are the highest-level products made available by the OCO Project, using TANSO-FTS spectral radiances, and algorithm build version 7.3.

The GOSAT team at JAXA produces GOSAT TANSO-FTS Level 1B (L1B) data products for internal use and for distribution to collaborative partners, such as ESA and NASA. These calibrated products are augmented by the OCO Project with additional geolocation information and further corrections. Thus produced Level 1B products (with calibrated radiances and geolocation) are the input to the &quot;ACOS&quot; Level 2 production process.

Even though the GES DISC is not publicly distributing Level 1B ACOS products, it should be known that changes in this version are affecting both Level 1B and Level 2 data. An important enhancement in Level1B will address the degradation in the number of quality-passed soundings. 

Elimination of many systematic biases, and better agreement with TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network), is expected in Level 2 retrievals. The key changes to the L2 algorithm include scaling the O2-A band spectroscopy (reducing XCO2 bias by 4 or 5 ppm); using interpolation with the instrument lineshape [ ILS ] (reducing XCO2 bias by 1.5 ppm); and fitting a zero level offset to the A-band. Users have to also carefully familiarize themselves with the disclaimer in the new documentation. 

An important element to note are the updates on data screening. Although a Master Quality Flag is provided in the data product, further analysis of a larger set of data has allowed the science team to provide an updated set of screening criteria. These are listed in the data user's guide, and are recommended instead of the Master Quality Flag.


Lastly, users should continue to carefully observe and weigh information from three important flags:
 

      &quot;sounding_qual_flag&quot; - quality of input data provided to the retrieval processing    

      &quot;outcome_flag&quot; - retrieval quality based upon certain internal thresholds (not thoroughly evaluated)

      &quot;sounding_qual_flag&quot; - quality of input data provided to the retrieval processing    

      &quot;outcome_flag&quot; - retrieval quality based upon certain internal thresholds (not thoroughly evaluated)

The precipitation estimate from AIRS Level 2 Support product, which are 6-min swath granules (240 per day) are combined here into one daily &quot;Level 2G&quot; global grid with dimensions (24x1440x720). Thus every hour is a &quot;layer&quot;, and the resulting grid cell size is 0.25 degree (~25 km). Thus the grid size is made to fit TRMM products. Since AIRS precipitation is retrieved at AMSU footprint resolution, which is about 45 km at nadir, many grid cells in this 0.25-deg grid are &quot;empty&quot;. The data are stored such that the first line is the South Pole. The geolocation information for every hour-layer is also provided in the file.</description>

Nevertheless, they are an order of magnitude larger in data volume than the remainder of the Standard Products and, many Standard Product users are expected to have little interest in the Cloud Cleared Radiance.

An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track for each of the approximate 2378 channels. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.</description>

                <description>The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The HSB level 1B data set contains HSB calibrated and geolocated brightness temperatures in degrees Kelvin. This data set is generated from HSB Level 1A digital numbers (DN), including 4 microwave channels in the 150 - 190 GHz region of the spectrum. A day's worth of data is divided into 240 scenes each of 6 minute duration. For the HSB measurements, an individual scene consists of 135 scanlines containing 90 cross-track footprints; thus there is a total of 135 x 90 = 12,150 footprints per HSB scene, which coincide very closely with the AIRS infrared footprints. HSB is primarily a humidity sounder that provides information on snow/ice cover and precipitation using the 150 GHz window channel, and the coarse distribution of moisture in the troposphere using the 183 GHz channels. Combined with simultaneous measurements from the AIRS and AMSU-A instruments, the calibrated HSB brightness temperatures will be used to initialize the atmospheric moisture profile required for the retrieval of the final AIRS geophysical products. An HSB level 1B daily summary browse product is also available to provide users with a global quick look capability when searching for data of interest.  Summary Browse Products are high-level pictorial representations of AIRS Instrument (AIRS Infrared, AMSU-A and HSB) data designed as an aid to ordering data from the GSFC DISC or EDG. the HSB instrument failed in November of 2003.</description>

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. Cloud-Cleared Radiances contain calibrated, geolocated channel-by-channel AIRS infrared radiances (milliWatts/m2/cm-1/steradian) that would have been observed within each AMSU footprint if there were no clouds in the FOV and produced along with the AIRS Standard Product, as they are the radiances used to retrieve the Standard Product. Nevertheless, they are an order of magnitude larger in data volume than the remainder of the Standard Products and, many Standard Product users are expected to have little interest in the Cloud Cleared Radiance. For these reasons they are a separate output file, but like the Standard Product, are generated at all locations.

An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track for each of the approximate 2378 channels. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.</description>

WARNING: On 2021/09/23 the EOS Aqua executed a Deep Space Maneuver (DSM). In the DSM, the spacecraft is turned such that the normal Earth field of regard is deep space.

The thermal impact of the DSM caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (SRF) of about 1% of the width of the SRF, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. This shift is reflected in the &#8220;spectral_freq&#8221; parameter (observed frequencies) in the L1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. The magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (BT) depends on the spectral gradient of each channel. Maximum BT shifts are approximately +- 0.5 K, although many channels experience far smaller BT shifts. Approximately 1803 channels have BT shifts of less than 0.1 K and 575 channels are now shifted in BT by more than 0.1 K, while 231 of these channels have BT shifts greater than 0.2 K.

Users of the L1b v5 product who are concerned that these shifts may impact their science investigations and applications are encouraged to switch to the AIRS L1c v6.7.4 product, which, among many other improvements, converts the spectra to a fixed frequency grid.         END OF WARNING.



The AIRS Level 1B Near Real Time (NRT) product (AIRIBRAD_NRT_005) differs from the routine product (AIRIBRAD_005) in 2 ways to meet the three hour latency requirements of the Land Atmosphere NRT Capability Earth Observing System (LANCE): (1) The NRT granules are produced without previous or subsequent granules if those granules are not available within 5 minutes, (2) the predictive ephemeris/attitude data are used rather than the definitive ephemeris/attitude.

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Infrared (IR) level 1C data set contains AIRS infrared calibrated and geolocated radiances in W/m2/micron/ster. This data set is generated from AIRS level 1B data. The spectral coverage of L1C data is from 3.74 to 15.4 mm. The nominal spectral resolution lambda / delta lambda = 1200. The spectrum is sampled twice per spectral resolution element in a total of 2645 spectral channels. A day of AIRS data is divided into 240 granules (scenes) each of 6-minute duration. For the AIRS IR measurements, an individual granule contains 135 pixels across-track and 90 along-track pixels; there are total of 135 x 90 = 12,150 pixels per granule. AIRS employs a 49.5 degree crosstrack scanning with a 1.1 degree instantaneous field of view (IFOV) to provide twice daily coverage of essentially the entire globe in a 1:30 PM sun synchronous orbit with the 13.5 x 13.5 km2 spatial resolution at nadir. The L1C swath products are derived from the L1B swath products. The primary purpose of the level 1C is to generate the spectra of radiances without spectral gaps caused by the instrument design and bad spectral points. The AIRS L1C data can be used for comparative (with other IR measurements) studies and for weather-climate research.

The AIRS Support Products include higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product plus intermediate output (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 pressure levels between 1100 and .016 mb. An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data. This normally corresponds to approximately 1/15 of an orbit but exactly 45 scanlines of AMSU-A data or 135 scanlines of AIRS and HSB data. The Level 2 retrieval products and climatology CO2 are assumed as the initial state for the Vanishing Partial Derivative (VPD) retrieval algorithm that separately determines the tropospheric CO2 mixing ratio. The AIRS Level 2 tropospheric CO2 product is the average of the solutions for a 2 x 2 array of adjacent AIRS Level 2 retrieval spots, covering a 90 km x 90 km area at nadir. Retrievals for which the solutions for the 2 x 2 arrays satisfy a spatial coherence QA that requires agreement of the separate retrievals to be within 2 ppm in an RMS sense are included in the standard product. Retrievals that fail this QA test are included in the support product.</description>

                <description>The mass concentration ammonia in the atmosphere, consists of products generated for the study of atmospheric ammonia. Atmospheric ammonia is an important component of the global nitrogen cycle. In the troposphere, ammonia reacts rapidly with acids such as sulfuric and nitric to form fine particulate matter. These ammonium containing aerosols affect Earth's radiative balance, both directly by scattering incoming radiation and indirectly as cloud condensation nuclei. Major sources of atmospheric ammonia involve agricultural activities including animal husbandry, especially concentrated animal feeding operations and fertilizer use. Major sinks of atmospheric ammonia involve dry deposition and wet removal by precipitation, as well as conversion to particulate ammonium by reaction with acids. Measurements of ambient NH3 are sparse, but satellites provide a means to monitor atmospheric composition globally. Using the AIRS/AMSU satellite this algorithm provides monthly measurements of derived atmospheric NH3 for September 2002 through August 2016.</description>

However, the VIS/NIR granules are only produced in the daytime so there will always be fewer VIS/NIR granules. The primary purpose of the VIS/NIR channels is the detection and flagging of significant inhomogeneities in the infrared field-of-view,which may adversely impact the quality of the temperature and moisture soundings. Therefore the VIS/NIR radiance product has a higher spatial resolution than the Infrared radiance product. Each VIS/NIR scan has 9 alongtrack footprints and 720 across track footprints. For ease in comparing with the infrared product which has 135 along track footprints and 90 across track footprints, the VIS/NIR product has additional dimensions to account for the 9 additional alongtrack and 8 additional across track footprints.</description>

                <description>The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product plus intermediate output (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 pressure levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than in the Standard Product profiles. The horizontal resolution is 50 km. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance, or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team. The Support Product is generated at all locations as Standard Products. 

An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.</description>

                <description>The Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (SBUV) from Nimbus-4 Level-3 monthly zonal mean (MZM) product (BUVN04L3zm) is derived from the Level-2 retrieved ozone profiles. Ozone retrievals are generated from the v8.6 SBUV algorithm. A Level-3 MZM file computes zonal means covering 5 degree latitude bands for each calendar month. For this product there are 72 months of data from May 1970 through April 1976. There are a total of 36 latitudinal bands, 18 in each hemisphere. Profile data are provided at 21 layers from 1013.25, 639.318, 403.382,254.517, 160.589, 101.325,63.9317, 40.3382, 25.4517, 16.0589, 10.1325, 6.39317,4.03382, 2.54517, 1.60589, 1.01325,0.639317, 0.403382, 0.254517, 0.160589 and 0.101325 hPa (measured at bottom of layer). NOTE: Some profiles have 20 layers and do not report the top most layer. Mixing ratios are reported at 15 layers from 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0 and 50.0 hPa (measured at middle of layer). 

The MZM product averages retrievals that meet the criteria for a good retrieval as determined by error flags in the Level 2 data. A good retrieval is defined as satisfying the following conditions:

 1) Profile Error Flag = 0 or 1 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = solar zenith angle &gt; 84 degrees).
 2) Total Error Flags = 0, 1, 2 or 5 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = not used; 2 = solar zenith angle &gt; 84 degrees; large discrepancy between profile total and best total ozone).

NOTE - Total error flag = 5 is anomalously applied at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles where the B-Pair total ozone estimate is not as reliable as the ozone profile under these conditions. This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.

The zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria:

 1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month.
 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band.
 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15).</description>

Furthermore, near-surface pollution is one of the most challenging problems for Earth observations from space. However, with an improved ability to monitor pollution from satellites from DISCOVER-AQ, scientists could make better air quality forecasts, more accurately determine the sources of pollutants in the air and more closely determine the fluctuations in emissions levels. In short, the more accurate data scientists have at hand, the better society is able to deal effectively with lingering pollution problems. During the DISCOVER-AQ mission in 2014, the CAR instrument was flown aboard NASA P-3 aircraft and obtained measurements of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) at different scales over agricultural and urban areas in Colorado, USA.

                <description>The scientific objectives of FIRE/ACE are to study impact of Arctic clouds on radiation exchange between surface, atmosphere, and space, and the influence of surface characteristics of sea ice, leads, and ice melt ponds on these clouds. FIRE/ACE will attempt to document, understand, and predict the Arctic cloud-radiation feedbacks, including changes in cloud fraction and vertical distribution, water vapor cloud content, cloud particle concentration and size, and cloud phase as atmospheric temperature and chemical composition change. FIRE/ACE uses the data to focus on improving current climate model simulations of the Arctic climate, especially with respect to clouds and their effects on the surface energy budget. In addition, FIRE/ACE addresses a number of scientific questions dealing with radiation, cloud microphysics, and atmospheric chemistry.

                <description>CAR Kuwait Oil Fire mission measured bidirectional reflectance function of smoke from Kuwait oil fires during the Kuwait Oil Fire Smoke Experiment. Measurements were also taken over the Saudi Arabian desert with overlying desert dust, and Persian Gulf waters with some overlying aerosols. This experiment was a part of an international research effort in response to an environmental crisis, when over 600 oil wells in Kuwait were ignited by Iraqi forces in 1991. The resulting fires produced large plumes of smoke that had significant effects on the Persian Gulf region but limited global effects. Between May 16 and June 12, 1991, the Kuwait Oil Fire Smoke Experiment (KOFSE) was conducted in the Persian Gulf Region. The purpose of KOFSE was to determine the chemical and physical nature of the smoke and to investigate its potential effects on air quality, weather, and climate.

                <description>This is a global inventory of methane emissions from fuel exploitation (GFEI) created for the NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS). The emission sources represented in this dataset include fugitive emission sources from oil, gas, and coal exploitation following IPCC 2006 definitions and are estimated using bottom-up methods. The inventory emissions are based on individual country reports submitted in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). For those countries that do not report, the emissions are estimated following IPCC 2006 methods. Emissions are allocated to infrastructure locations including mines, wells, pipelines, compressor stations, storage facilities, processing plants, and refineries.
  The purpose of the inventory is to be used as a prior estimate of fuel exploitation emissions in inverse modeling of atmospheric methane observations. GFEI only includes fugitive methane emissions from oil, gas, and coal exploitation activities and does not include any combustion emissions as defined in IPCC 2006 category 1A.

                <description>NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are &quot;open-loop&quot; (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.

GLDAS-2.2 is new to the GES DISC archive and currently includes a main product from CLSM-F2.5 with Data Assimilation for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE-DA) from February 2003 to present.  The GLDAS-2.2 data are available in two production streams: one with GRACE data assimilation outputs (the main production stream), and one without GRACE-DA (the early production stream).  Since the GRACE data have a 2-6 month latency, the GLDAS-2.2 data are first created without GRACE-DA, and are designated as the Early Product (EP), with about 1 month latency.  Once the GRACE data become available, the GLDAS-2.2 data are processed with GRACE-DA in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Product archive. 

This data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.2 Catchment Land Surface Model daily 0.25 x 0.25 degree with GRACE-DA. 

The GLDAS-2.2 GARCE-DA product was simulated with Catchment-F2.5 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data product contains 24 land surface fields from February 1, 2003 to present.

The simulation started on February 1, 2003 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 Daily Catchment model simulation, forced with the meteorological analysis fields from the operational European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System.  The total terrestrial water anomaly observation from GRACE satellite was assimilated (Li et al, 2019). Due to the data agreement with ECMWF, this GLDAS-2.2 daily product does not include the meteorological forcing fields.

The GLDAS-2.2 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.</description>

GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. 

This data product is for GLDAS-2.1 Catchment 3-hourly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was simulated with the Catchment-F2.5 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. 

The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.

In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.

If you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.

                <description>NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are &quot;open-loop&quot; (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.

GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  

This data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 Catchment 1.0 degree 3-hourly dataset. 

The GLDAS-2.1 3 hourly 1.0 degree product was simulated with the Catchment-F2.5 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. 

The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.

The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.

The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.</description>

The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.

This data set, GLDAS-2.0 monthly 1.0 degree, contains a series of land surface variables generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.0 3-hourly data simulated from the Catchment Land Surface Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data set currently cover from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the forcing data becomes available. The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.

The GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO&#8217;s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.

In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.

If you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.</description>

The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.

GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. 

This data product is for GLDAS-2.1 VIC monthly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 3-hourly data simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.

The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.

In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask. Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values. The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README. The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.

If you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.</description>

                <description>NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are &quot;open-loop&quot; (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.

This data set,  GLDAS-2.0 VIC monthly 1.0 degree, contains a series of land surface variables generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.0 3-hourly data simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data set currently cover from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the forcing data becomes available. The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.

The GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO&#8217;s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.

In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.

 Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Previous versions have been superseded by Version 07.
The TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), the first of its kind in space, is an electronically scanning radar, operating at 13.8 GHz that measures the 3-D rainfall distribution over both land and ocean, and defines  the layer depth of the precipitation.
                                          
The 1B21 calculates the received power at the PR receiver input point from the Level-0 count value which is linearly proportional to the logarithm of the PR receiver output power. To convert the count value to the input power, extensive internal calibrations are applied, which are mainly based upon the system model, temperature dependence of model parameters and many temperature sensors attached at various locations of the PR. Periodically the input-output characteristics are measured using an internal calibration loop for the IF unit and later receiver stages. To make an absolute calibration, an Active Radar Calibrator (ARC) is placed at Kansai Branch of CRL and overall system gain of the PR is being measured every 2 months.  Using the transfer function based on the above internal and external calibrations, the PR received power is obtained. Note that the value assumes that the signal follows the Rayleigh fading, so if the fading characteristics of a scatter is different, a small bias error may occur (within 1 or 2 dB).

This dataset contains TRMM Micrwave Imager (TMI) L1B calibrated radiances in terms of Brightness Temperatures.

The TMI calibration algorithm (1B11) converts the radiometer counts to antenna temperatures by applying a linear relationship of the form Ta = c1 + c2 x count. The coefficients are provided by the instrument contractor. Antenna temperatures are corrected for cross-polarization and spill over to produce brightness temperatures (Tb), but no antenna beam pattern correction or sample to pixel averaging are performed. Temperatures are provided at 104 scan positions for the low frequency channels and 208 scan positions at 85 GHz. There are four samples per pixel (3 -dB beamwidth) at 10 GHz, two samples at 19, 22, and 37 GHz, and one sample per pixel for the 85 GHz.

 Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Previous versions have been superseded by Version 07.

This TRMM Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) Level 1B Calibrated Radiance Product (1B01) contains calibrated radiances and auxiliary geolocation information from the five channels of the VIRS instrument, for each pixel of each scan. The data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), which includes both core and product specific metadata applicable to the VIRS measurements. A file contains a single orbit of data with a file size of about 95 MB. The EOSDIS &quot;swath&quot; structure is used to accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays. There are 16 files of VIRS 1B01 data produced per day.

For channels 1 and 2, Level 1B radiances are derived from the Level 1A (1A01) sensor counts by computing calibration parameters (gain and offset) derived from the counts registered during space and solar and/or lunar views. New calibration parameters are produced every one to four weeks. Channels 3, 4, and 5 are calibrated using the internal blackbody and the space view. These calibration parameters, together with a quadratic term determined pre-launch, are used to generate a counts vs. radiance curve for each band, which is then used to convert the earth-view pixel counts to spectral radiances.

Geolocation and channel data are written out for each pixel along the scan, whereas the time stamp, scan status (containing scan quality information), navigation, calibration coefficients, and solar/satellite geometry are specified on a per-scan basis. There are in general 18026 scans along the orbit pre-boost and 18223 post-boost, with each scan consisting of 261 pixels. The scan width is about 720 km pre-boost and 833 km post-boost.

Changes in horizontal resolution resulting from the TRMM boost that occurred on 24 August 2001:

Pre-Boost (before 7 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 91.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 720 km; Horizontal Resolution: 2.2 km 

Post-Boost (after 24 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 92.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 833 km; Horizontal Resolution: 2.4 km

.

This is environmental data that includes the profiles of atmospheric parameters assumed in the L2 retrieval algorithm.

This GPM data type provides single- and dual-frequency-derived precipitation estimates from the Ku and Ka radars of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on the core GPM spacecraft. The output consists of three main classes of precipitation products derived from the: 
+ the Ku-band frequency over a wide swath (245 km);
+ the Ka-band frequency over a narrow swath (125 km), and
+ the dual-frequency data over the narrow swath. 

The Ka-band results are further divided into the standard and high-sensitivity estimates. In the standard sensitivity mode, the fields of view within the inner swath are matched to those of the Ku-band. Data from these matched-beam Ku- and Ka-band fields of view are used to derive the dual-frequency precipitation products. The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar instrument field of view (IFOV). 

The dual-frequency retrieval benefits from having co-aligned measurements at Ku- and Ka-bands. Data from these measurements are used to infer properties of the particle size distribution, which are expected to lead to improved estimates of rainfall rate and equivalent liquid water content. Dual-frequency data are expected to improve the capability to discriminate among water, ice, and mixed-phase hydrometeors as a function of height. This capability is particularly important in convective storms where a bright-band signature, associated with mixed-phase hydrometeors, is usually not detectable. In addition, the different attenuation rates of the Ku- and Ka-bands allow differential attenuation techniques to be used to estimate the path integrated attenuation. The high-sensitivity Ka-band channel is expected to have 6 dB greater sensitivity than the Ku- and standard Ka-band channels and to provide enhanced detection capabilities at the light rainfall rates.</description>

The 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.


The 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: 
+ TMI (TRMM)
+ GMI, (GPM)
+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)
+ AMSR2 (Aqua)
+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) 
+ MHS (METOP A,B)
+ ATMS (NPP)
+ SAPHIR (MT1)


This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. 

The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.</description>

This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.

The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.</description>

The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.


The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:
+ TMI (TRMM)
+ GMI, (GPM)
+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)
+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)
+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) 
+ MHS (METOP A,B)
+ ATMS (NPP)
+ SAPHIR (MT1)

This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.

The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.</description>

+ ATMS (NPP)
+ SAPHIR (MT1)

This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.

These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty. ABSTRACT</description>

The &quot;CLIM&quot;  products differ from their &quot;regular&quot; counterparts (without the &quot;CLIM&quot; in the name) by the ancillary data they use.

The 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&amp;19, METOP A&amp;B), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields.

By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.

 Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07. 

The &quot;CLIM&quot;  products differ from their &quot;regular&quot; counterparts (without the &quot;CLIM&quot; in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the &quot;CLIM&quot; output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.

The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:
+ TMI (TRMM)
+ GMI, (GPM)
+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)
+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)
+ MHS (NOAA 18,19)
+ MHS (METOP A,B)
+ ATMS (NPP)
+ SAPHIR (MT1)

This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.

                <description>Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.

   The 2AKa algorithm provides precipitation estimates from the Ka radar of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar on the core GPM spacecraft. The product contains two swaths of data corresponding to the scans of the Ka radar. The first swath contains matched scans (MS), which are intended to be co-aligned with the Ku-band instantaneous fields of view (IFOV). The second swath contains the high-sensitivity scans (HS), which are interleaved between the Ku/Ka-MS swaths. Both swaths are narrow and centered within the interior of the Ku swath. This is a single-frequency retrieval of precipitation; no information from the Ku radar is used. The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar IFOV for each swath.
	
   This is a single-frequency retrieval that relies on Ka-band data only. While the dual-frequency retrieval should give better overall estimates, that algorithm requires co-aligned Ku-band data. This 2AKa product will be produced independently and would not be impacted by any operational issues with the Ku-band radar. The high sensitivity to smaller hydrometeors should result in precipitation estimates in lighter precipitation then the Ku-only data.

   It is important to note the difference between the single- and the dual-frequency (DF) algorithms. While this 2AKa dataset is a single-frequency retrieval, the DF algorithm employs both KuPR and KaPR L1B standard products as inputs. The DF algorithm cannot be executed unless both L1B products are available. Pixels observed by DPR can be categorized into three types: pixels in the inner swath of normal scans (observed both by KuPR and KaPR), pixels in the outer swath of normal scans (observed only by KuPR), and pixels in the interleaved scans (observed only by KaPR in the high-sensitivity mode). The KuPR algorithm is executed for pixels in both inner and outer swaths of normal scans. The KaPR algorithm is executed for pixels in the inner swath of normal scans and in the interleaved scans. The DF algorithm is executed for pixels of all the three kinds.

                <description>This is the new, GPM-like, format for TRMM Precipitation Radar L2 data that now incorporates what was known as 2A21, 2A23 and 2A25 datasets.

The primary purpose of 2A21 is to compute the path-integrated attenuation (PIA) using the surface reference technique (SRT). The surface reference technique rests on the assumption that the difference between the measurements of the normalized surface cross section outside and within the rain provides an estimate of the PIA. The secondary purpose of 2A21 is to compute the normalized radar cross sections (&quot;sigma-not&quot; or Normalized Radar Cross-Sectin (NRTS)) of the surface under rain-free conditions. 

Main objectives of 2A23 are as follows:
(a) Detection of bright band (BB) and determination of the height of BB, the
strength of BB, and the width (i.e. thickness) of BB when BB exists.
(b) Classification of rain type into the following three categories:
- stratiform,
 - convective,
 - other,
where &quot;other&quot; means (ice) cloud only and/or maybe noise.
 (c) Detection of shallow isolated and shallow non-isolated.
 (d) Output of Rain/No-rain flag.
 (e) Computation of the estimated height of freezing level.
 (f) Output of the height of storm top. 

The objectives of 2A25 are to correct for the rain attenuation in measured radar reflectivity (Zm) and to estimate the instantaneous three-dimensional distribution of rain from the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) data. The estimated vertical profiles of attenuation-corrected radar reflectivity factor (Ze) and rainfall rate (R) are given at each resolution cell of the PR. The estimated rainfall rate at the actual surface height and the average rainfall rate between the two predefined altitudes (2 and 4 km) are also calculated for each beam position.

Changes in horizontal resolution resulting from the TRMM boost that occurred on 24 August 2001:

Pre-Boost (before 7 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 91.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 215 km; Horizontal Resolution: 4.3 km 

Post-Boost (after 24 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 92.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 247 km; Horizontal Resolution: 5.0 km</description>

                <description>Version 6 is the current version of this dataset. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 6.

The Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.

Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).

The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the &#8216;fit&#8217; of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a &#8216;missing flag&#8217; in the retrieval.

Estimating vertical profiles of latent heating released by precipitating cloud systems is one of the key objectives of TRMM, together with accurately measuring the horizontal distribution of tropical rainfall.

The method uses TRMM PR information [precipitation-top height (PTH), precipitation rates at the surface and melting level, and rain type] to select heating profiles from lookup tables. Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types&#8212;convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)&#8212;were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean&#8211;Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The CSH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.

Because observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the CSH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.

 Latent heating variables are retrieved utilizing two separate algorithms for tropics and for mid-latitudes. First, location of each GPM KuPR pixel is assigned to either tropics or mid-latitudes, depending on monthly maps of precipitation types determined in a similar manner as described in Takayabu (2008). Then, three dimensional convective latent heating are retrieved, Q1-QR (Q1R), and Q2, applying either tropical/mid-latitude algorithms to precipitation data observed from GPM DPR (KuPR).

The Level 3 DPR products present the user with summary information over daily and monthly time periods. These gridded products are in a convenient gridded form and can be used easily in comparisons with other satellite and ground data.

  The Level 3 DPR algorithm accumulates instantaneous precipitation estimates from the Level 2 retrieval algorithms into grids over a day and month time span. There are two grid resolutions: 5.0 degrees and 25 kms. For each grid box, the core statistics are the number of measurements, mean, and standard deviation. Most variables are also conditioned on surface type and precipitation type with other three-dimensional fields adding the height above the ellipsoid. Unless otherwise specified, the means are conditioned on precipitation being present (rain rate &gt; 0). For the daily product, the mean square statistic is saved rather than the standard deviation. In addition to the daily and monthly products is a simplified joint daily product that contains a subset of the fields from the full daily product.</description>

The precipitation estimates in the 3DPRD product are a subset of those in the full daily 3DPR product; the retrieval estimates are the same. Since this is a subset, the product is smaller, and Level 3 DPR products present the user with summary information over daily and monthly time periods. These gridded products are in a convenient gridded form and can be used easily in comparisons with other satellite and ground data. 

		The Level 3 DPR joint algorithm subsets precipitation estimates from the Level 3 daily products. In addition, it adds time information from Level 2 instantaneous data to give a date/time for the last measurement in each grid box. The product contains one 0.25 x 25 km grid with separate indices for the ascending and descending parts of the GPM orbit.</description>

Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.

Estimating vertical profiles of latent heating released by precipitating cloud systems is one of the key objectives of TRMM, together with accurately measuring the horizontal distribution of tropical rainfall.

The method uses TRMM PR information [precipitation-top height (PTH), precipitation rates at the surface and melting level, and rain type] to select heating profiles from lookup tables. Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types&#8212;convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)&#8212;were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean&#8211;Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The CSH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.

Because observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the CSH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.

The Gridded Orbital Spectral Latent Heating is actually one orbit gridded onto a global map with  0.25x0.25 degree grid cell size. These latent heating profiles from the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) rain. The granule temporal size is one orbit.</description>

They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the &quot;CLIM&quot; output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.

3GPROF products provide global gridded monthly/daily precipitation averages from multiple satellites that can be used for climate studies. The 3GPROF products are based on retrievals from high-quality microwave sensors, which are sensitive to liquid and ice-phase precipitation hydrometeors in the atmosphere.</description>

Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.

Estimating vertical profiles of latent heating released by precipitating cloud systems is one of the key objectives of TRMM, together with accurately measuring the horizontal distribution of tropical rainfall.

The method uses TRMM PR information [precipitation-top height (PTH), precipitation rates at the surface and melting level, and rain type] to select heating profiles from lookup tables. Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types&#8212;convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)&#8212;were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean&#8211;Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The SLH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.

Because observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the SLH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.

The Gridded Orbital Spectral Latent Heating is actually one orbit gridded onto a global map with  0.5 degree x 0.5 degree grid cell size. These latent heating profiles from the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) rain. The granule temporal size is one orbit.</description>

Monthly Spectral Latent Heating produces 0.25x0.25 degree grid of latent heating profiles from the TRMM PR rain. The grids are in the Planetary Grid 2 structure matching the Dual-frequency PR on the core GPM observatory that covers 67S to 67N degrees of latitudes.  Areas beyond the ±40 degrees of latitudes are padded with empty grid cells.

Because observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the SLH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.

Monthly Spectral Latent Heating produces 0.5 degree x 0.5 degree grid of latent heating profiles from the TRMM PR rain.

Estimating vertical profiles of latent heating released by precipitating cloud systems is one of the key objectives of TRMM, together with accurately measuring the horizontal distribution of tropical rainfall.

The method uses TRMM PR information [precipitation-top height (PTH), precipitation rates at the surface and melting level, and rain type] to select heating profiles from lookup tables. Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types&#8212;convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)&#8212;were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean&#8211;Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The SLH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.

                <description>This is the new (GPM-formated) TRMM product. It replaces the old TRMM_3A25,3A26

Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.

This is the GPM-like formatted TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) monthly gridded data, first released with the &quot;V8&quot; TRMM reprocessing. The TRMM radar Level 3 grids are now consistent with the GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). The closest ancestor of this dataset was the monthly radar statistics 3A25.

This product consists of monthly statistics of the PR measurements at 0.25x0.25 degrees, and monthly histograms and statistics at 5x5 degrees, horizontal resolution.

The objective of the algorithm is to calculate various daily statistics from the level 2 PR
output products. Four types of statistics are calculated:
1. Probabilities of occurrence (count values)
2. Means and standard deviations
3. Histograms
4. Correlation coefficients
In all cases, the statistics are conditioned on the presence of rain or some other quantity such
as the presence of stratiform rain or the presence of a bright-band. For example, to compute
the unconditioned mean rain rate, the conditional mean must be multiplied by the probability
of rain which, in turn is calculated from the ratio of rain counts to the total number of
observations in the box of interest.

The grids are in the Planetary Grid 2 structure matching the Dual-frequency PR on the core GPM observatory that covers 67S to 67N degrees of latitudes. The low resolution 5x5 deg grid covers 70S to 70N. Areas beyond the ±40 degrees of latitudes are padded with empty grid cells.

The Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.

Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).

The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the &#8216;fit&#8217; of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a &#8216;missing flag&#8217; in the retrieval.

Consistent rainfall retrievals from each instrument mandate the basic sensor radiance measurements (brightness temperature, Tb) to be consistently inter-calibrated.

Fundamental to this concept is the existence of the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI), a conically scanning multifrequency radiometer in non-sun-synchronous orbit, which serves as a radiometric transfer standard for the other passive microwave sensors on cooperative (polar orbiting) constellation satellites. This GPM inter-satellite calibration process is known as XCAL.

                <description>Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 07.

This product contains the calibrated received power from the Ka-band of the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) aboard the core satellite of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission.

One of the reasons for adding the Ka-band frequency (35.5 GHz) channel to the DPR is to provide information on the drop-size distribution that can be obtained from non-Rayleigh scattering effects at the higher frequency. Another reason for the new Ka-band channel is to provide more accurate estimates of the phase-transition height in precipitating systems. This information is very important not only in increasing the accuracy of rain rate estimation by the DPR itself, but in improving rain estimation by passive microwave radiometers.

The Ka-band Radar has a more complex scanning geometry, defined by two modes: Matched (MS) and High-sensitivity (HS). In the first type of scan (MS), the Ka Radar beams are matched to the central 25 beams of the Ku Radar, providing a swath of 120 km (within the 245km swath of the Ku Radar). In the second type of scan (HS), the Ka is operated in the high-sensitivity mode to detect light rain and snow.  In this case, its beams are interlaced within the matched scan pattern, resulting in 49 cross-track beams which, however, still cover the 120-km swath.

                <description>This dataset has been superseded by version 2.  It provides an annual average of a global planetary boundary layer (PBL) height climatology derived from the COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 and TerraSAR-X Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) measurements from June 2006 to December 2015. 


The COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 mission consists of a six-satellite constellation launched in 2006.  Each satellite carries the IGOR GPS receiver and is equipped with fore and aft looking antenna to track both setting and rising occultations.  The constellation provides globally distributed measurements across different local times.  The TerraSAR-X (TSX) is a X-band SAR imaging satellite with GPS RO being a secondary measurement.  It also carries an IGOR receiver and has been collecting GPS RO measurements since 2011.  The instrument tracks the L-band microwave signal broadcast by a GPS satellite in a limb-viewing geometry. The IGOR receivers on COSMIC and TSX are capable of tracking the GPS signals in open loop through the middle to lower troposphere, which is essential for obtaining data with high quality for PBL height estimation, especially at low latitudes.  The refractivity profiles from COSMIC and TSX form the basis for this PBL height product.



For each occultation, the PBL height is calculated as the height where the vertical gradient of the refractivity (dN/dz) is minimum.  This algorithm is designed to locate the height where a large vertical change in refractivity occurs, corresponding to the transition from the free troposphere to the PBL.   More details can be found in Ao et al. (2012).  Each PBL height is associated with a time (starting time of the occultation) and location (latitude and longitude of the tangent point at the minimum altitude).  The PBL height data are then binned into 2 degree x 2 degree latitude/longitude regions and averaged to produce the mean and standard deviation values in the climatology products.  The refractivity profile has a vertical resolution of about 200 m and represents an along path horizontal averaging of ~100 km.  Thus, occultations with tangent points near the coast may represent averaging over both land and ocean and should be interpreted with care. 

The refractivity gradient method used here is not the only method that can be used to estimate the PBL height.  Other algorithms have been proposed, including looking at &quot;breakpoint&quot; instead of minimum gradient, wavelet covariance transform, and using variables like bending angles or specific humidity instead of refractivity.  However, the basic principle is the same.  The difference between the different algorithms is small where the PBL is well-defined, with a strong capping inversion.</description>

For each occultation, the PBL height is calculated as the height where the vertical gradient of the refractivity (dN/dz) is minimum.  This algorithm is designed to locate the height where a large vertical change in refractivity occurs, corresponding to the transition from the free troposphere to the PBL.   More details can be found in Ao et al. (2012).  This is the latest version of this collection which supersedes previous versions.</description>

                <description>This dataset has been superseded by version 2.  It provides seasonal averages of a global planetary boundary layer (PBL) height climatology derived from the COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 and TerraSAR-X Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) measurements from June 2006 to December 2015. 


The COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 mission consists of a six-satellite constellation launched in 2006.  Each satellite carries the IGOR GPS receiver and is equipped with fore and aft looking antenna to track both setting and rising occultations.  The constellation provides globally distributed measurements across different local times.  The TerraSAR-X (TSX) is a X-band SAR imaging satellite with GPS RO being a secondary measurement.  It also carries an IGOR receiver and has been collecting GPS RO measurements since 2011.  The instrument tracks the L-band microwave signal broadcast by a GPS satellite in a limb-viewing geometry. The IGOR receivers on COSMIC and TSX are capable of tracking the GPS signals in open loop through the middle to lower troposphere, which is essential for obtaining data with high quality for PBL height estimation, especially at low latitudes.  The refractivity profiles from COSMIC and TSX form the basis for this PBL height product.

For each occultation, the PBL height is calculated as the height where the vertical gradient of the refractivity (dN/dz) is minimum.  This algorithm is designed to locate the height where a large vertical change in refractivity occurs, corresponding to the transition from the free troposphere to the PBL.   More details can be found in Ao et al. (2012).  Each PBL height is associated with a time (starting time of the occultation) and location (latitude and longitude of the tangent point at the minimum altitude).  The PBL height data are then binned into 2 degree x 2 degree latitude/longitude regions and averaged to produce the mean and standard deviation values in the climatology products.  The refractivity profile has a vertical resolution of about 200 m and represents an along path horizontal averaging of ~100 km.  Thus, occultations with tangent points near the coast may represent averaging over both land and ocean and should be interpreted with care. 

The refractivity gradient method used here is not the only method that can be used to estimate the PBL height.  Other algorithms have been proposed, including looking at &quot;breakpoint&quot; instead of minimum gradient, wavelet covariance transform, and using variables like bending angles or specific humidity instead of refractivity.  However, the basic principle is the same.  The difference between the different algorithms is small where the PBL is well-defined, with a strong capping inversion.</description>

                <description>Scientists at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center generate groundwater and soil moisture drought indicators each week. They are based on terrestrial water storage observations derived from GRACE satellite data and integrated with other observations, using a sophisticated numerical model of land surface water and energy processes.

This data product is GRACE Data Assimilation for Drought Monitoring (GRACE-DA-DM) U.S. Version 4.0 data product and supersedes the GRACE-DA-DM Version 2.0. 

The GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 is based on the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) Fortuna 2.5 version simulation that was created within the Land Information System data assimilation framework (Kumar et al., 2016). This simulation used the latest GRACE RL06 (GRACE; 2002-2017) and GRACE Follow On (GRACE-FO; 2018-present) Mascon solutions version 2, at 0.25 degree resolution, from the University of Texas at Austin (Save et al., 2016; Save, 2020). The CLSM soil parameters were updated to address a soil moisture dry limit issue found near Zapata, Texas. Because the root zone soil moisture frequently reaches the dry limit there, drought conditions are often &#8220;normal&#8221; when the area should be in drought. The new soil parameters resolved the issue, and the root zone soil moisture now matches closely the in-situ observation near Zapata. In the data assimilation, the baseline for Terrestrial Water Storage anomaly computation was updated to the 2003-2019 mean, whereas previous simulations used the 2003-2016 mean. The percentile computation was switched to a 7-day moving average climatology, instead of monthly, to improve the temporal transition of drought/wetness conditions.

The GRACE-DA-DM V1.0 was created by the stand alone CLSM (an older version) using the GRACE-Tellus 1 degree data from the Center for Space Research at University of Texas. The GRACE data assimilation (DA) is executed on a grid-to-grid basis in V2.0, while a basin scale average was used in V1.0 (Zaitchik et al. 2008). The V2.0 data were reprocessed (on June 14, 2017), using the GRACE RL05 Mascon solutions version 1 data set from UT CSR, for the entire period from April 1, 2002 to June 5, 2017. The reprocessing included fixes in the DA and increased the bedrock depth by 3 meters to enhance the drought indicator calculations. 

The GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 uses the same configuration as the V2.0 for the DA scheme and increased bedrock depth, with the updates previously mentioned, thus supersedes the previous versions. 

The GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 data product contains three drought indicators: Groundwater Percentile, Root Zone Soil Moisture Percentile, and Surface Soil Moisture Percentile. These drought indicators express wet or dry conditions as a percentile, indicating the probability of occurrence within the period of record from 1948 to 2014. The drought indicator data are daily, but available only one day (Monday) per week.  The data have  a spatial resolution of 0.125 x 0.125 degree over North America and range from April 1, 2002 to present (with a 3-6 months latency).  The data are archived in NetCDF format.</description>

                <description>Scientists at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center generate groundwater and soil moisture drought indicators each week. They are based on terrestrial water storage observations derived from GRACE-FO satellite data and integrated with other observations, using a sophisticated numerical model of land surface water and energy processes.

This data product is GRACE Data Assimilation for Drought Monitoring (GRACE-DA-DM) Global Version 3.0 from a global GRACE and GRACE-FO data assimilation and drought indicator product generation (Li et al., 2019). It varies from the other GRACE-DA-DM products which are from the U.S. GRACE-based drought indicator product generation (Houborg et al., 2012).
The GRACE-DA-DM Global V3.0 is similar to the GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 product. Both products are based on the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) Fortuna 2.5 version simulation that was created within the Land Information System data assimilation framework (Kumar et al., 2016). GRACE-DA-DM Global V3.0 drought indicator maps are derived from the GLDAS_CLSM025_DA1_D product, at 0.25 degree resolution, forced by ECMWF meteorological data, and assimilated RL06 GRACE and GRACE-FO data from the University of Texas at Austin (Save et al., 2016; Save, 2020). The  GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 is at 0.125 degree, which is based on a model simulation (not published at GES DISC) forced by NLDAS-2 meteorological data and assimilated with RL06 GRACE/GRACE-FO data.   
More information on GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 and previous versions of the data can be found in the README.

The GRACE-DA-DM Global V3.0 data product contains three drought indicators: Groundwater Percentile, Root Zone Soil Moisture Percentile, and Surface Soil Moisture Percentile. These drought indicators express wet or dry conditions as a percentile, indicating the probability of occurrence within the period of record from 1948 to 2014. The drought indicator data are daily, but available only one day (Monday) per week.  The data have a spatial resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degree with global coverage (60S, 180W, 90N, 180E), and a temporal range from February 2003 to present (with a 3-6 month latency). The data are archived in NetCDF format.

The GRACE-DA-DM is an operational project which produces groundwater and soil moisture drought indicators each week.  The operational data is available weekly with a 2-9 day latency from the NASA GRACE project home page found under the Documentation tab.  The GRACE-DA-DM data distributed here at GESDISC is the final archive version, which is generated after the latest GRACE-FO data are available.</description>

                <description>These data are the Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes Version-3 (GSSTF3) Dataset recently produced through a MEaSUREs funded project led by Dr. Chung-Lin Shie (UMBC/GEST, NASA/GSFC), converted to HDF-EOS5 format. The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. 

This suite of GSSTF version 3 products is the 0.25x0.25 deg resolution version of the GSSTF 2c collections. It does not contain, however, the &quot;WB&quot; variable - 'lowest 500-m precipitable water' (g/cm**2). 

This is the Daily (24-hour) product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 0.25  degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 1440x720 size. 

As in previous versions, the daily fluxes have first been produced for each individual available SSM/I satellite tapes (e.g., F08, F10, F11, F13, F14 and F15). Then, the Combined daily fluxes are produced by averaging (equally weighted) over available flux data/files from various satellites.  These Combined daily flux data are considered as the &quot;final&quot; GSSTF, Version 3, and are stored in this HDF-EOS5 collection.
      
      There are only one set of GSSTF, Version 3, Combined data, &quot;Set1&quot; 
       
      The &quot;individual&quot; daily flux data files, produced for each individual satellite, are also available in HDF-EOS5, although from different collections:
      GSSTF_Fxx_3, where Fxx are the individual satellites (F08, F10, etc..)
      
      The input data sets used for this recent GSSTF production include the upgraded and improved datasets such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Version-6 (V6) product of brightness temperature [Tb], total precipitable water [W], and wind speed [U] produced by the Wentz of Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), as well as the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis-2 (R2) product of sea skin temperature [SKT], 2-meter air temperature [Tair], and sea level pressure [SLP]. Relevant to this MEaSUREs project, these are converted to HDF-EOS5, and are stored in the GSSTF_NCEP_3 collection.

The Combined daily files will be updated for those three years once an improved set of Individual daily data files are produced using corrected and updated SSM/I F15 input files.
      
        (b) The current Combined daily data files are produced with at most 4 combined satellites,
             i.e., F10, F11, F13 and F14 for May-Nov 1997,
               and F11, F13, F14 and F15 for Jan-May 2000.

                <description>These data are the Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes Version-2c (GSSTF2c) Dataset recently produced through a MEaSUREs funded project led by Dr. Chung-Lin Shie (UMBC/GEST, NASA/GSFC), converted to HDF-EOS5 format. The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. 

GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the &quot;artifactitious&quot; trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently. 

GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful &quot;Rice Cooker Theory&quot; by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., &quot;To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality&quot; should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c. 

This is the Daily (24-hour) product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size. 

A finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3. 

The GSSTF, Version 2c, daily fluxes have first been produced for each individual available SSM/I satellite tapes (e.g., F08, F10, F11, F13, F14 and F15). Then, the Combined daily fluxes are produced by averaging (equally weighted) over available flux data/files from various satellites.  These Combined daily flux data are considered as the &quot;final&quot; GSSTF, Version 2c, and are stored in this HDF-EOS5 collection.

      Special notes:
      
        (a) For Y2006, Y2007 and Y2008, the current Combined daily data files do not include the F15 Individual daily data files due to problematic calibration in F15. The Combined daily files will be updated for those three years once an improved set of Individual daily data files are produced using corrected and updated SSM/I F15 input files.
      
        (b) The current Combined daily data files are produced with at most 4 combined satellites,
             i.e., F10, F11, F13 and F14 for May-Nov 1997,
               and F11, F13, F14 and F15 for Jan-May 2000.

                <description>These data are the Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes Version-3 Dataset recently produced through a MEaSUREs funded project led by Dr. Chung-Lin Shie (UMBC/GEST, NASA/GSFC), converted to HDF-EOS5 format. The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. 

This is the fine resolution version of the previously released GSSTFM.2c. 

This is the Monthly product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 0.25x00.25 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 1440x720 size. The monthly product is a result of averaging of a month worth of daily GSSTF3 files. Starting with Version 3, the &quot;WB&quot; variable, &quot;lowest 500-m precipitable water&quot; has been discontinued.  

The monthly temporal and one-degree spatial resolution of the product can be used to examining climate variability at these scales. Oceanic evaporation contributes to the net fresh water input to the oceans and drives the upper ocean density structure and consequently the circulation of the oceans.

The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. 

GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the &quot;artifactitious&quot; trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently. 

GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful &quot;Rice Cooker Theory&quot; by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., &quot;To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality&quot; should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c.
      
      This is the Monthly product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size. The monthly product is a result of averaging of a month worth of daily GSSTF2c files. Starting with Version 2c, there is only one set of Combined data, &quot;Set1&quot;.  A finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3.

The coefficients are computed from the HIRDLS Level 2 profiles with a Kalman filter approach using both forward and backward passes in time. Expressed as the mean and up to 7 sine and cosine coefficients (4 waves for ascending and descending, 7 waves for combined), these coefficients may be used to compute values at any longitude. The data are provided on a pressure grid with 24 levels per decade, corresponding to about 1 km vertical resolution. The useful vertical range of the data is 215 to 20 hPa. The precision values are given by the root-mean square of the differences between the estimated fields and the input data.

The data are stored in the version 5 Hierarchical Data Format for the Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS5), which is an extension of the HDF5 format.

Many of these data products, especially those based on surface measurements, are spatially and/or temporally sparse or incomplete in coverage, so procedures were developed to fill missing values. 
The data product is comprised of a sequence of daily global files, where quantities are mapped into 1.0-degree equivalent equal-area grid, with time sampling is reported at daily or 3-hourly intervals. The time period overlap among the products covers 10 years from 1998 to 2007.</description>

Its land surface parameters, surface soil moisture, land surface (skin) temperature, and vegetation water content, are derived from passive microwave remote sensing data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). There are two files per day, one ascending (daytime) and one descending (nighttime), archived as two different products. This document is for the daytime product. The data set covers the period from May 2012, when the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission-1st Water GCOM-W1 satellite was launched, to the present.

The LPRM is based on a forward radiative transfer model to retrieve surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. The land surface temperature is derived separately from the AMSR2's Ka-band (36.5 GHz). A unique feature of this method is that it can be applied at any microwave frequency, making it very suitable to exploit all the available passive microwave data from various satellites.

Input data are from the AMSR2 spatial-resolution-matched brightness temperatures (L1SGRTBR) product, daytime passes, as processed using LPRM (i.e., LPRM/AMSR2/GCOM-W1 Level 2 product, LPRM_AMSR2_SOILM2_V001).</description>

                <description>TMI/TRMM surface soil moisture (LPRM) L3 1 day 25 km x 25 km daytime V001 is a Level 3 (gridded) data set. Its land surface parameters, surface soil moisture, land surface (skin) temperature, and vegetation water content, are derived from passive microwave remote sensing data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). There are two files per day, one daytime and one nighttime, archived as two different products. This document is for the daytime product. The data set covers the period from December 1997 to April 2015 (when the instruments on the TRMM satellite were shut down in preparation for its reentry into the earth's atmosphere).

The LPRM is based on a forward radiative transfer model to retrieve surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. The land surface temperature is derived separately from TMI's Ka-band (37 GHz). A unique feature of this method is that it can be applied at any microwave frequency, making it very suitable to exploit all the available passive microwave data from various satellites.

Input data are from the TMI Brightness Temperatures (1B-11) product, daytime passes, as processed using LPRM (i.e., LPRM/TMI/TRMM Level 2 product, LPRM_TMI_SOILM2_V001).</description>

                <description>The Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) contains a wealth of information that can be used for weather and climate studies. By combining the assimilation of observations with a frozen version of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS), a global analysis is produced at an hourly temporal resolution spanning from January 1980 through present (Gelaro et al., 2017). It can be difficult to parse through a multidecadal dataset such as MERRA-2 to evaluate the interannual variability of weather that occurs on a daily timescale, let alone determine the occurrence of an extreme weather event. This data collection provides climate statistics compute using MERRA-2 to assist in the analysis of extreme temperature and precipitation events and the accompanying the large scale meteorological patterns across a time period of over four decades.

                <description>M2TCNPLTM (or tavgC_3d_ltm_Np) is a 3-dimensional monthly data collection for climatological long term mean and standard deviation representing the interannual variability on a monthly timescale, derived from monthly Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) datasets. V2 of this data collection is calculated with data from January 1991 to December 2020. In contrast, V1, the original version, is computed with data from an earlier 30-year time of 1981-2010.

This collection consists of meteorological diagnostics at 12 vertical pressure levels (e.g.,850 hPa, 500hPa, and 200 hPa), such as air temperature, wind components, and both relative and specific humidity. 

MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4. The dataset covers the period of 1980-present, with a  latency of ~3 weeks after the end of the previous month.

                <description>The Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) contains a wealth of information that can be used for weather and climate studies. By combining the assimilation of observations with a frozen version of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS), a global analysis is produced at an hourly temporal resolution spanning from January 1980 through present (Gelaro et al., 2017). It can be difficult to parse through a multidecadal dataset such as MERRA-2 to evaluate the interannual variability of weather that occurs on a daily timescale, let alone determine the occurrence of an extreme weather event. This data collection is a climatological long term mean and standard deviation representing the interannual variability on a monthly timescale.

Version 2 of the global catalogue of emissions from large SO2 point sources combines data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA&#8217;s EOS Aura spacecraft, the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) on the NASA&#8211;NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP), and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the ESA/Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P) spacecraft.

The catalogue MSAQSO2L4 file contains the site coordinates, source type, country, source name, annual SO2 emissions, annual emission uncertainties, and the number of satellite pixels in the fitting area for three satellite instruments as well as for their weighted average.

The emission estimates are based on operational version 2 OMI and OMPS Principal Component Analysis (PCA) retrieval algorithm SO2 slant column density (SCD) data (Li et al., 2020) as well as on new TROPOMI Covariance-Based Retrieval Algorithm (COBRA) SCD data (Theys et al., 2021). A single time-independent site-specific Air-Mass Factor (AMF) value for each site was calculated (McLinden et al., 2014) and applied consistently to each satellite SCD dataset to derive SO2 vertical column densities (VCDs=SCDs/AMFs). The emission estimate method is based on a fit of satellite VCDs to an empirical plume model developed to describe the SO2 spatial distribution near emission point sources. The plume model assumes that the SO2 concentrations emitted from a point source decline exponentially with distance and that they are affected by turbulent diffusion that can be described by a two-dimensional (2D) exponentially modified Gaussian function. The total SO2 mass is derived from the fit and the annual emission rate is calculated as the ratio between the total mass and the prescribed SO2 lifetime.</description>

                <description>These data are a part of Multi-Decadal Sulfur Dioxide Climatology from Satellite Instruments (MEaSUREs-12-0022 project).

The catalogue MSAQSO2L4 file contains the site coordinates, source type, country, source name, annual SO2 emissions and uncertainties, and the number of EOS Aura/OMI satellite SO2 measurements used for emissions estimates near each source. 

The 2018 data have been recently added to the catalogue and the minor version in the file name is now upgraded to v01-04.  There are no systematic differences between the old  and new minor versions. The fitting areas are a slightly  different for some sites, but the resulting differences in the data are within the known uncertainties ranges. A major update to the catalogue is aniticipated in the summer of 2019.

The emissions  estimates are based on the fitting of the operational Aura/OMI planetary boundary layer (PBL) SO2 data produced with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm (10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA2022) and a site-specific AMF adjustment  for each site (Fioletov et al., 2016). The emission estimate method for linking OMI level 2 SO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) to emissions is based on a fit of OMI VCDs to an empirical plume model developed to describe the SO2 spatial distribution (as seen by OMI) near emissions point sources. The plume model assumes that the SO2 concentrations emitted from a point source decline exponentially along wind direction and are affected by turbulent diffusion that can be described by a 2D Gaussian function. The average  SO2 mass is derived from the fit and the emission rate is calculated as the ratio between the total mass and the prescribed SO2 lifetime.</description>

The scene reflectivities of the Earth at blue and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths (320 nm to 415 nm) are low over most surfaces (except ice and snow), and are almost independent of the seasonal changes in vegetation on land and in the oceans. This makes it ideal for examining changes in radiation reflected back to space from changes in cloud and aerosol amounts, especially as affected by the start of climate change.

The v8.6 SBUV algorithm estimates the ozone nadir profile and total column from SBUV measurements, and differs from the v8.0 SBUV algorithm via the use of 1) the Brion-Daumont-Malicet ozone cross sections, 2) an OMI-derived cloud-height climatology, 3) a revised a priori ozone climatology, and 4) inter-instrument calibration based on comparisons with no local time difference.
 
The MSO3L3zm5 product is stored as a single HDF5 file, and has a size of 0.4 MB. The MZM product contains 5.0-degree-wide latitude zones with data between latitude -80.0 and  80.0 degrees. The data cover the time period from May 1970 through July 2013. Data coverage during the BUV mission from 1970 - 1977 contains many gaps after October 1973, and there are no data between November 1976 and November 1978.

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

The algorithm is based on Spencer and Christy (1990) with the LIMB 93 limb correction based on latitude, longitude, month, and scan angle.  The MSU instruments measure the thermal emission of radiation by molecular oxygen at four frequencies near 60 GHz.  North (south) of 66.7N (S) the footprint data are assigned to grid boxes in a weighted method depending on footprint latitude.  Horizontal averaging is used to fill some of the empty grid boxes.</description>

                <description>The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.

This dataset consists of a suite of historical trends in terrestrial hydrology over the conterminous United States estimated for the water years of 1980-2015 using the NCA-LDAS daily reanalysis. NCA-LDAS provides gridded daily outputs from the uncoupled Noah version 3.3 land surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution forced with NLDAS-2 meteorology (Xia et al., 2012), rescaled Climate Prediction Center precipitation, and assimilated satellite-based soil moisture, snow depth, and irrigation products (Jasinski et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2019).

Trends in annual hydrologic indicators are reported using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test at p &lt; 0.1 significance. An additional precipitation trend field (annual total), with no significance test applied, is included for comparison purposes. Collectively, these fields represent the bulk of the results presented in Jasinski et al. (2019).</description>

The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB data files). 

The NLDAS-2 monthly primary forcing data were generated from the NLDAS-2 hourly primary forcing data, as monthly accumulation for total precipitation, convective precipitation, and potential evaporation, and monthly average for other variables. The convective precipitation monthly total is the hourly convective fraction multiplied by the hourly precipitation (both from the NLDAS-2 &quot;File A&quot; files), and then summed over all hours of the month. Monthly period of each month is from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month. The one exception to this is the first month (Jan. 1979) that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979, except for the monthly accumulated  precipitation and convective precipitation that both start from 12Z 01 Jan 1979. 

The monthly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two files, &quot;File A&quot; and &quot;File B&quot;.  &quot;File A&quot; is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven meteorological forcing fields.

The non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  NLDAS-2 is providing a second forcing file, &quot;File B&quot;, in which the surface temperature, humidity, and wind fields are represented not at 2-meters and 10-meters above the height of the NLDAS terrain, but rather at the same height above the NLDAS terrain as the height above the NARR terrain of the lowest prognostic level of the NARR assimilation system (namely, the same height above the model terrain as the lowest prognostic level of the mesoscale Eta model, which is the assimilating model in NARR). 

The surface downward surface radiation field in &quot;File B&quot; is taken directly from NARR, without any bias correction.  The precipitation and convective precipitation fields in &quot;File B&quot; are also taken directly from NARR, and are used to calculate the convective fraction provided in &quot;File A&quot;.  The aerodynamic conductance is &quot;File B&quot; is also taken from NARR.

The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly. The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB format).

Mosaic was developed by Koster and Suarez (1994, 1996) to account for subgrid vegetation variability with a tile approach. Each vegetation tile carries its own energy and water balance and soil moisture and temperature.  Each tile has three soil layers, with the first two in the root zone. In NLDAS, Mosaic is configured to support a maximum of 10 tiles per grid cell with a 5% cutoff that ignores vegetation classes covering less than 5% of the cell. Additionally in NLDAS, all tiles of Mosaic in a grid cell have a predominant soil type and three soil layers with fixed thickness values of 10, 30, and 160 cm (hence constant rooting depth of 40 cm and constant total column depth of 200 cm).

The Noah model was developed as the land component of the NOAA NCEP mesoscale Eta model [Betts et al. (1997); Chen et al. (1997); Ek et al. (2003)].  As used in NLDAS-2, recent modifications were made to Noah's cold-season [Livneh et al. (2010)] and warm-season [Wei et al. (2012)] parameterizations.  Noah serves as the land component in the evolving Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional atmospheric model, the NOAA NCEP coupled Climate Forecast System (CFS), and the Global Forecast System (GFS).  The model simulates the soil freeze-thaw process and its impact on soil heating/cooling and transpiration, following Koren et al. (1999).  The model has four soil layers with spatially invariant thicknesses of 10, 30, 60, and 100 cm.  The first three layers form the root zone in non-forested regions, with the fourth layer included in forested regions.

In early 2021, the OCO Team identified an issue with OCO-2 level 2 products processed since January 28, 2020. The Ancillary Geometric Product (AGAP) file, a static file used in OCO-2 Geolocation processing, was inadvertently replaced with an obsolete version. This AGAP file included a ~300 m pointing error. As a result, all OCO-2 Level 2, version 10r, data files for the period January 28 - December 31, 2020, were corrected and replaced. The replacement process was completed by the end of June, 2021. The significance of this error has been described in Kiel et al. (2019; doi:10.5194/amt-12-2241-2019).

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its buildup in the atmosphere. The OCO-2 project uses the LEOStar-2 spacecraft that carries a single instrument. It incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO2 near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O2) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers.

In early 2021, the OCO Team identified an issue with OCO-2 level 2 products processed since January 28, 2020. The Ancillary Geometric Product (AGAP) file, a static file used in OCO-2 Geolocation processing, was inadvertently replaced with an obsolete version. This AGAP file included a ~300 m pointing error. As a result, all OCO-2 Level 2, version 10r, data files for the period January 28 - December 31, 2020, were corrected and replaced. The replacement process was completed by the end of June, 2021. The significance of this error has been described in Kiel et al. (2019; doi:10.5194/amt-12-2241-2019).

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its buildup in the atmosphere. The OCO-2 project uses the LEOStar-2 spacecraft that carries a single instrument. It incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO2 near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O2) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers. This collection is the output from the algorithm retrieving the column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction XCO2 and other quantities from the spectra collected by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2).</description>

In early 2021, the OCO Team identified an issue with OCO-2 level 2 products processed since January 28, 2020. The Ancillary Geometric Product (AGAP) file, a static file used in OCO-2 Geolocation processing, was inadvertently replaced with an obsolete version. This AGAP file included a ~300 m pointing error. As a result, all OCO-2 Level 2, version 10r, data files for the period January 28 - December 31, 2020, were corrected and replaced. The replacement process was completed by the end of June, 2021. The significance of this error has been described in Kiel et al. (2019; doi:10.5194/amt-12-2241-2019).

This is the retrospective processing where the calibration data is estimated from the full timeseries of data (before, during, and after the measurements), and is expected to be of slightly higher quality.</description>

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its buildup in the atmosphere. 

The OCO-3 incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements ofreflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO2 near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O2) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers. The three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated independently. Their raw data numbers (DN) are delivered correlated in time to the Level 1B process as Level 1A products. Each band has 1016 spectralelements, although some are masked out in the L2 retrieval.

This L1B product results from calibration mode measurements (e.g., Lunar,Solar, Dark observations), and thus it differs from the OCO3_L1B_Science(L1bSc) product. The differences in the product formats are only in the geolocation information provided. Whereas the L1bSc products report geolocation data for each sounding, calibration products report the directionof the boresight vector.This is the retrospective processing where the calibration data is estimated from the full timeseries of data (before, during, and after the measurements), and is expected to be of slightly higher quality.

Oxygen-A Band cloud screening algorithm is one of the primary cloud screening tools implemented in the operational OCO processing pipeline. The algorithm was introduced and applied to early GOSAT data  with further analysis performed on OCO-2 simulations.

The OCO ABO2 algorithm employs a fast Bayesian retrieval to estimate surface pressure and surface albedo from high resolution spectra of the molecular oxygen (O2) A-band, near 0.765 µm. The radiative transfer forward model (FM) assumes a clear-sky condition, i.e. Rayleigh scattering only, such that differences between the modeled and measured radiances are apparent when the measurement scene contains cloud or aerosol.

The radiative transfer forward model (FM) assumes a clear-sky condition, i.e. Rayleigh scattering only, such that differences between the modeled and measured radiances are apparent when the measurement scene contains cloud or aerosol.

OMI calibrated and geolocated radiances from 159 channels in UV1(264-311 nm), 557 channels in UV2 (307-383 nm) and 751 channels in VIS (349-504) spectral regions, spectral irradiances, calibration measurements, and all derived geophysical atmospheric products (Level-2 and 3) are archived at the NASA Goddard DAAC.

OMLER spectral surface reflectance product contains monthly and yearly climatology of the Earth's surface Lambert Equivalent Reflectance (LER) for 23 wavelengths in the spectral range 309 to 500 nm, at a spatial resolution of 0.5 by 0.5 degrees. This LER is defined as the required reflectance of an isotropic surface needed to match the observed top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in a pure Rayleigh scattering atmosphere under cloud free conditions and no aerosols. The climatology is based on statistical analysis of the three years of OMI version 03 radiance data (Oct 2004-Oct 2007). This product also provides minimum spectral surface reflectivity observed during the three year period.

The OMLER product file is produced in the version 5 Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). It is roughly 300 MB in size.</description>

                <description>The OMI/Aura and MODIS/Aqua Merged Cloud Product 1-Orbit L2 Swath 13x24 km (OMMYDCLD) is a Level-2 orbital product that combines cloud parameters retrieved by the Ozone Mapping Instrument (OMI) on the Aura satellite with collocated statistical information for cloud parameters retrieved by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Aqua spacecraft. This product is designed to take advantage of the synergy between OMI and MODIS, which both fly on satellites in the NASA A-Train constellation of Earth-observing satellites that follow similar orbital tracks and collect near-simultaneous observations. This product can be used for cloud-clearing, detection of multi-layered clouds, and other applications that may exploit these multi-spectral measurements.

The algorithm for the OMMYDCLD product co-locates daytime cloud parameters from MODIS onto the OMI visible (VIS) pixel for a given OMI orbit and generates statistical information from the collocated MODIS pixels. For each OMI granule, the orbit start and end times are used to select the corresponding 5-minute MODIS granules for processing. A contiguous list of MODIS granules spanning the full duration of the OMI orbit are selected based on the relative time lag between Aqua and Aura. The algorithm lead for this product is NASA OMI scientist Dr. Joanna Joiner.

                <description>The OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 product is part of the MEaSUREs (Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments) suite of products.

It is retrieved from the NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) Nadir Mapper (NM) spectrometer and provides contiguous daily global monitoring of anthropogenic and volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2), an important pollutant and aerosol precursor that affects both air quality and the climate. The product is based on the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center principal component analysis (PCA) spectral fitting algorithm (Li et al., 2013, 2017), and continues (Zhang et al., 2017) NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) standard Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument SO2 product (OMSO2). 

The latest OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V2 product uses new Jacobian lookup tables and more realistic model based a priori profiles in anthropogenic SO2 retrievals. This helps to more accurately account for the pixel-to-pixel variation in SO2 sensitivity due to different factors such as the vertical distribution of SO2, solar and viewing angles, surface reflectivity, and cloudiness. As compared with the previous OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V1.2 product that assumes the same SO2 sensitivity for all OMPS pixels, the new V2 anthropogenic SO2 retrievals have reduced retrieval biases especially over background regions (see Figure 1 for an example). The same updated PCA SO2 retrieval algorithm (Li et al., 2020) is also used to produce the recently released OMSO2 V2 product (doi:10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA2022). The new OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V2 product thus offers enhanced consistency between the NASA EOS standard (OMI) and continuity (OMPS) SO2 data records

Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is a short-lived gas primarily produced by volcanoes, power plants, refineries, metal smelting and burning of fossil fuels. Where SO2 remains near the Earth's surface, it is toxic, causes acid rain, and degrades air quality. Where SO2 is lofted into the free troposphere, it forms aerosols that can alter cloud reflectivity and precipitation. In the stratosphere, volcanic SO2 forms sulfate aerosols that can result in climate change.</description>

                <description>This is version 2 of  Princeton University MEaSUREs Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) dataset, which provides a set of estimates of PET based on near surface meteorology and surface radiation data derived from a combination of reanalysis, satellite and gridded gauge data. The rationale of the project is to reduce the error from the input meteorological forcing and provide a variety of widely-used PET methods for different research and application purposes.

PET is estimated using three methods: Penman open-water method (Penman), Priestley-Taylor method (PT), Reference crop evapotranspiration using the UN Food and Agricultural Organization approach (FAO). The Penman equation assumes PET occurs from an open water surface and calculates PET based on observations of surface net radiation, near-surface air temperature, wind speed, and specific humidity (Shuttleworth, 1993). The PT equation calculates PET based on surface net radiation and near-surface air temperature and does not account for the aerodynamic component (Priestley and Taylor, 1972). The FAO equation is a specific application of the Penman-Monteith equation for crop and short-grass reference surfaces and is based on surface net radiation, near-surface air temperature, wind speed, and specific humidity (Allen, 1998).  As a follow-on to PET_PU_3H025 Version 1, PET_PU_3H025 Version 2 seeks to continue to reduce the error from the input meteorological forcing and provide a variety of widely-used PET methods for different research and application purposes. The modifications include the addition of the FAO tall reference crop equation, an extension of the radiation data and temporal coverage, the usage of the GLASS satellite albedo to estimate upward short-wave radiation and the estimation of ground heat flux based on diurnal phase shift of net radiation.

This second version of the dataset is estimated at a 3 hourly temporal resolution and 0.25x0.25 degrees spatial resolution globally, spanning the 33-year period 1984-2016. Datasets are stored as a 3-dimensional array with dimension 720 x 1440 x 8 for each day, in NetCDF-4 format.

The DOI for version 1 of the data is: 10.5067/GPZDZYELYG1A.</description>

The retrieval algorithm for Sentinel-5P TROPOMI methane product is a physics based method that uses the Oxygen-A band (760 nm) and absorption bands in shortwave infrared spectrum. In Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI methane algorithm, the atmosphere forward model simulates the absorbing gas (oxygen, methane, water vapor, and carbon monoxide) optical properties, as well as aerosol optical properties with size distribution, refractive index, and number concentration. The inversion is performed based on the forward calculation, the measurement, and the prior information. Cloud filtering is critical in methane retrieval, S5P methane algorithm applies re-gridded Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) cloud mask data. Additional cloud filters based on S5P/TROPOMI measurements and the FRESCO apparent surface pressure will be applied when VIIRS cloud data are not available. Other current data filters in the retrieval algorithm include land-only pixels (excluding mountainous areas), spectrum intensity, solar zenith angle and instrument zenith angle. 

The S5P/TROPOMI methane retrieval is for non-time-critical (NTC) data stream only, and its main outputs include the column averaged dry air mixing ratio of methane, the random error, and the biased corrected dry air methane fraction data based on the retrieved surface albedo. 

The data are stored in an enhanced netCDF-4 format.</description>

The S5P_TROPOZ_CCD algorithm uses TROPOMI Level-2 ozone column measurements and the cloud parameters provided by the S5P_CLOUD_OCRA and S5P_CLOUD_ROCINN, the average values of the tropospheric ozone columns below 270 hpa can be determined. The S5P_TROPOZ_CSA algorithm uses the correlation between could top pressure and the ozone column above the cloud. The retrieval depends on the amount of measurements with a high cloud cover. The products are restricted in the tropical region (-20 degrees to 20 degrees of latitude).

The main outputs of the Copernicus S5P/TROPOMI tropospheric ozone product include the tropospheric ozone column and corresponding errors, upper tropospheric ozone and corresponding errors, stratospheric ozone column and corresponding errors, and the retrieval quality flags. The data are stored in an enhanced netCDF-4 format.</description>

The retrieval algorithm for Sentinel-5P TROPOMI SO2 from ultraviolet spectral measurements is the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) method. The relevant information of absorption cross section, instrument characteristics, cloud cover, and geolocation are utilized to derive SO2 slant column density (SCD). A sensitive spectral window of 312 to 326 nm is set as the baseline for the slant column fit with another two spectral windows (325 to 335 nm, 360 to 390 nm) to account for the non-linear effects in those high column amount cases. The SCD is then corrected with the empirical offsets to the systematic biases. The air mass factor (AMF) Look-up table has been created with the LIDORT radiative transfer model. The outputs of the DOAS algorithm are SO2 vertical column density (VCD), SCD, AMF, the DOAS-type averaging kernels (AK), and error estimates.</description>

Ozone retrievals are generated from the v8.6 SBUV algorithm. A Level-3 MZM file computes zonal means covering 5 degree latitude bands for each calendar month. For this product there are 156 months of data from February 1985 through January 1998. There are a total of 36 latitudinal bands, 18 in each hemisphere. Profile data are provided at 21 layers from 1013.25, 639.318, 403.382,254.517, 160.589, 101.325,63.9317, 40.3382, 25.4517, 16.0589, 10.1325, 6.39317,4.03382, 2.54517, 1.60589, 1.01325,0.639317, 0.403382, 0.254517, 0.160589 and 0.101325 hPa (measured at bottom of layer). NOTE: Some profiles have 20 layers and do not report the top most layer. Mixing ratios are reported at 15 layers from 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0 and 50.0 hPa (measured at middle of layer). 

The MZM product averages retrievals that meet the criteria for a good retrieval as determined by error flags in the Level 2 data. A good retrieval is defined as satisfying the following conditions:

 1) Profile Error Flag = 0 or 1 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = solar zenith angle &gt; 84 degrees).
 2) Total Error Flags = 0, 1, 2 or 5 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = not used; 2 = solar zenith angle &gt; 84 degrees; large discrepancy between profile total and best total ozone).

NOTE - Total error flag = 5 is anomalously applied at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles where the B-Pair total ozone estimate is not as reliable as the ozone profile under these conditions. This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.

The zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria:

 1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month.
 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band.
 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15).</description>

Mixing ratios are reported at 15 layers from 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0 and 50.0 hPa (measured at middle of layer). 

The MZM product averages retrievals that meet the criteria for a good retrieval as determined by error flags in the Level 2 data. A good retrieval is defined as satisfying the following conditions:

 1) Profile Error Flag = 0 or 1 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = solar zenith angle &gt; 84 degrees).
 2) Total Error Flags = 0, 1, 2 or 5 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = not used; 2 = solar zenith angle &gt; 84 degrees; large discrepancy between profile total and best total ozone).

NOTE - Total error flag = 5 is anomalously applied at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles where the B-Pair total ozone estimate is not as reliable as the ozone profile under these conditions. This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.

The zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria:

 1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month.
 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band.
 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15).</description>

Inter-instrument radiometric offsets are removed with SNPP-CrIS chosen as the &quot;standard&quot;.  CHIRP follows the original instrument storage, i.e., granule in, granule out, and contains all information needed for retrievals (including cross-track, along-track, fov id, etc.). This version of CHIRP, SNDR13CHRP1, is the primary CHIRP product which provides a full radiance record from 2002 onwards starting with AIRS from September 1, 2002 to August 30, 2016, switching to the SNPP CrIS instrument on September 1, 2016.  The SNDR13CHRP1 product then switches to using JPSS-1 CrIS radiances starting September 1, 2018.  This selection of time periods provides the best match to times when the microwave sounders on each of these platforms exhibited good performance and avoids long outages (such as SNPP CrIS in early Spring 2019).  CHIRP is available for AIRS, CrIS-SNPP, and CrIS-JPSS-1 for time periods not used in the product distributed here, and are named SNDR13CHRP1AQCal, SNDR13CHRP1SNCal, and SNDR13CHRP1J1Cal respectively.  </description>

                <description>This data set provides an estimate of the surface air temperature.  It infers a value for each grid point based on nearby and distant values of the input Level-2 datasets and estimates of the variance of those values, with lower variances given higher weight.  

The Spatial Statistical Data Fusion (SSDF) surface continental United States (CONUS) products, fuse data from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) instrument on the EOS-Aqua spacecraft with data from the Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite (CrIMSS) instruments on the Suomi-NPP spacecraft.  The CrIMSS instrument suite consists of the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) infrared sounder and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) microwave sounder. These are all daily products on a ¼ x ¼ degree latitude/longitude grid covering the continental United States (CONUS).  

The SSDF algorithm infers a value for each grid point based on nearby and distant values of the input Level-2 datasets and estimates of the variance of those values, with lower variances given higher weight. Performing the data fusion of two (or more) remote sensing datasets that estimate the same physical state involves four major steps: (1) Filtering input data; (2) Matching the remote sensing datasets to an in situ dataset, taken as a truth estimate; (3) Using these matchups to characterize the input datasets via estimation of their bias and variance relative to the truth estimate; (4) Performing the spatial statistical data fusion. We note that SSDF can also be performed on a single remote sensing input dataset. The SSDF algorithm only ingests the bias-corrected estimates, their latitudes and longitudes, and their estimated variances; the algorithm is agnostic as to which dataset or datasets those estimates, latitudes, longitudes, and variances originated from.

The CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder). The AIRS instrument is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. The AIRS CLIMCAPS Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 100 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 300 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km. 
 

Cloud-Cleared Radiances contain calibrated, geolocated channel-by-channel AIRS infrared radiances (milliWatts/m2/cm-1/steradian) that would have been observed if there were no clouds in the FOV.

An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track for each of the approximate 2378 channels. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.</description>

The CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder). The AIRS instrument is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. The AIRS CLIMCAPS Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 100 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 300 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km. 
 
The CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere
profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.

An AIRS level 2 granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.

                <description>This data set provides an estimate of the surface air temperature.  It infers a value for each grid point based on nearby and distant values of the input Level-2 datasets and estimates of the variance of those values, with lower variances given higher weight.

The Spatial Statistical Data Fusion (SSDF) surface continental United States (CONUS) products, fuse data from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) instrument on the EOS-Aqua spacecraft with data from the Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite (CrIMSS) instruments on the Suomi-NPP spacecraft.  The CrIMSS instrument suite consists of the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) infrared sounder and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) microwave sounder.  It infers a value for each grid point based on nearby and distant values of the input Level-2 datasets and estimates of the variance of those values, with lower variances given higher weight. These are all daily products on a ¼ x ¼ degree latitude/longitude grid covering the continental United States (CONUS).  

The SSDF algorithm infers a value for each grid point based on nearby and distant values of the input Level-2 datasets and estimates of the variance of those values, with lower variances given higher weight. Performing the data fusion of two (or more) remote sensing datasets that estimate the same physical state involves four major steps: (1) Filtering input data; (2) Matching the remote sensing datasets to an in situ dataset, taken as a truth estimate; (3) Using these matchups to characterize the input datasets via estimation of their bias and variance relative to the truth estimate; (4) Performing the spatial statistical data fusion. We note that SSDF can also be performed on a single remote sensing input dataset. The SSDF algorithm only ingests the bias-corrected estimates, their latitudes and longitudes, and their estimated variances; the algorithm is agnostic as to which dataset or datasets those estimates, latitudes, longitudes, and variances originated from.

                <description>The Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) Level 1B data files contain brightness temperature measurements along with ancillary spacecraft, instrument, and geolocation data of the ATMS instrument on the Joint Polar Satellite System-1 (JPSS-1) platform. This platform is also known as NOAA-20 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).
 
The ATMS is a 22-channel mm-wave radiometer. The ATMS will measure upwelling radiances in six frequency bands centered at 23 GHz, 31 GHz, 50-58 GHz, 89 GHz, 66 GHz, and 183 GHz. The ATMS is a total power radiometer, with &amp;#8220;through-the-antenna&amp;#8221; radiometric calibration. Radiometric data is collected by a pair of antenna apertures, scanned by rotating flat plate reflectors. Scanning is performed cross-track to the satellite motion from sun to anti-sun, using the &quot;integrate-while-scan&quot; type data collection. The scan period is 8/3 second, synchronized to the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) using a spacecraft provided scan synchronization pulse.

Since the JPSS-1 satellite is orbiting at an altitude of about 830 km, the instantaneous spatial resolution on the ground at nadir is about 16 km, 32 km, or 75 km depending upon the channel. The brightness temperature data are contained in an array with 135 rows in the along-track direction, 96 columns in the cross-track direction, and a 3rd dimension for each of the 22 channels. The ATMS cross-track scan interval is 0.018 seconds and the along-track scan period is 8/3 seconds. Data products are constructed on six minute boundaries.

The ATMS is a total power radiometer, with &amp;#8220;through-the-antenna&amp;#8221; radiometric calibration. Radiometric data is collected by a pair of antenna apertures, scanned by rotating flat plate reflectors. Scanning is performed cross-track to the satellite motion from sun to anti-sun, using the &quot;integrate-while-scan&quot; type data collection. The scan period is 8/3 second, synchronized to the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) using a spacecraft provided scan synchronization pulse.

Since the JPSS-1 satellite is orbiting at an altitude of about 830 km, the instantaneous spatial resolution on the ground at nadir is about 16 km, 32 km, or 75 km depending upon the channel. The brightness temperature data are contained in an array with 135 rows in the along-track direction, 96 columns in the cross-track direction, and a 3rd dimension for each of the 22 channels. The ATMS cross-track scan interval is 0.018 seconds and the along-track scan period is 8/3 seconds. Data products are constructed on six minute boundaries.

Cloud clearing is the process of computing the clear column radiance for a given channel n, and represents what the channel would have observed if the entire scene were cloud free. The entire scene is defined as the ATMS field of regard (FOR) which includes and array of 3x3 CrIS field of views (FOV). The basic assumption of cloud-clearing is that if the observed radiances in each field-of-view are different, the differences in the observed radiances are solely attributed to the differences in the fractional cloudiness in each field of view while everything else (surface properties and atmospheric state) is uniform across the field of regard. 

A level 2 granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.
 
 The CLIMCAPS algorithm uses data from the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) as a first-guess for the atmospheric state.  Because MERRA-2 products typically have a latency from 3 to 7 weeks, so too do the CLIMCAPS products.</description>

                <description>The objective of this limited edition data collection is to examine the ammonia products generated by the ESSPA (Earth System Science Profiling Algorithm) algorithm from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) instruments. The CrIS instrument used for this product is deployed on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and uses the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer  with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions.

The NH3 L2 ammonia algorithm is based on an AER (Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc.) program initially developed to process TES (Tropospheric Emissions Spectrometer) trace gas products. This version runs within the ESSPA software framework: it uses the AER OSS forward model and an optimal estimation approach with a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Temperature and water profiles are obtained from the CLIMCAPS Field of Regard (FOR) products, as are initial guesses for surface temperature and emissivity. The algorithm consists of a two-step sequential retrieval the first step retrieves surface temperature and emissivity and the second step an ammonia profile. The algorithm produces ammonia retrievals on every field of view (FOV) in each FOR.

A level 2 granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints crosstrack by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.</description>

                <description>The CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite). The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Full Spectral Resolution (FSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 2211 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (645-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2000-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.

Cloud clearing is the process of computing the clear column radiance for a given channel n, and represents what the channel would have observed if the entire scene were cloud free. The entire scene is defined as the ATMS field of regard (FOR) which includes and array of 3x3 CrIS field of views (FOV). The basic assumption of cloud-clearing is that if the observed radiances in each field-of-view are different, the differences in the observed radiances are solely attributed to the differences in the fractional cloudiness in each field of view while everything else (surface properties and atmospheric state) is uniform across the field of regard. 

A level 2 granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.
 
 The CLIMCAPS algorithm uses data from the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) as a first-guess for the atmospheric state.  Because MERRA-2 products typically have a latency from 3 to 7 weeks, so too do the CLIMCAPS products.</description>

The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.

The CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.

While the CLIMCAPS uses measurements from both Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite), the RAMSES II only uses observations from ATMS. The ATMS instrument used for this product  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform. The RAMSES II algorithm doesn't have a cloud clearing process and produces all weather retrieval. A level 2 granule has been set as 6 minutes of data. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.

For the initial release of version 1 RAMSES II, a test data set of 8 months is provided. This includes the months of January, April, July and October of the years 2013 and 2015. The dataset is designed to allow research and comparisons over a full seasonal cycle and comparisons of different phases of the ENSO cycle

                <description>The Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) Level 1B data files contain brightness temperature measurements along with ancillary spacecraft, instrument, and geolocation data of the ATMS instrument on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Project (SNPP).

The ATMS instrument is a cross-track scanner with 22 microwave channels in the range 23.8-183.31 Gigahertz (GHz). The beam width is 1.1 degrees for the channels in the 160-183 GHz range, 2.2 degrees for the 80 GHz and 50-60 GHz channels, and 5.2 degrees for the 23.8 and 31.4 GHz channels. Since the SNPP satellite is orbiting at an altitude of about 830 km, the instantaneous spatial resolution on the ground at nadir is about 16 km, 32 km, or 75 km depending upon the channel. The brightness temperature data are contained in an array with 135 rows in the along-track direction, 96 columns in the cross-track direction, and a 3rd dimension for each of the 22 channels. The ATMS cross-track scan interval is 0.018 seconds and the along-track scan period is 8/3 seconds. Data products are constructed on six minute boundaries.

The ATMS (Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder) and CrIS (Crosstrack InfraRed Sounder) instruments are meant to operate together as a system, thus providing coverage of a much broader range of atmospheric conditions. The ATMS-CrIS system is referred to as CrIMSS (Cross-Track Infrared and Microwave Sounder Suite).

                <description>Version 3 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 3.
The goal of this data set is to create and archive a Level 2 SO2 Earth Science Data Record (ESDR)  from backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) measurements from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) flown on NASA's Nimbus - 7 satellite in 1978-1993. We apply TOMS ozone team  calibration techniques and consistent MEaSUREs SO2 (MS_SO2) algorithm, to obtain the best measurement-based ESDR of volcanic and anthropogenic SO2 masses and emissions. 

As part of the NASA's Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program, the Goddard Earth Science (GES) Data and Information Data Center (DISC) has released a new SO2 Earth System Data Record (ESDR), TOMSN7SO2, re-processed using new 4 UV wavelength bands MS_SO2 algorithm that spans the full Nimbus 7 data period. TOMSN7SO2 is a Level 2 orbital swath product, which will be used to study the fifteen-year SO2 record from the Nimbus-7 TOMS and to expand the historical database of known volcanic eruptions.

 Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is a short-lived gas primarily produced by volcanoes, power plants, refineries, metal smelting and burning of fossil fuels. Where SO2 remains near the Earth s surface, it is toxic, causes acid rain, and degrades air quality. Where SO2 is lofted into the free troposphere, it forms aerosols that can alter cloud reflectivity and precipitation. In the stratosphere, volcanic SO2 forms sulfate aerosols that can result in climate change.

                <description>This dataset (TOVSAMNA) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-6 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.

The Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.

The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).

These Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format. Each data set is representative of a different monthly average time period and for one of nine satellites. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.</description>

The TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), the first of its kind in space, is an electronically scanning single-frequency radar, operating at 13.8 GHz that measures the 3-D rainfall distribution over both land and ocean, and defines the layer depth of the precipitation.

PR 2A23 produces a rain/no-rain flag. Its main objectives are (1) to detect bright band (BB), (2) to classify rain type, and (3) to detect warm rain.

2A23 uses two different methods for classifying rain type: (1) vertical profile method (V-method) and (2) horizontal pattern method (H-method).  Both methods classify rain into three categories: stratiform, convective, and other. To make the results user-friendly, 2A23 outputs a unified rain type. Further information about 2A23 can be found in Awaka et al. (1998).

The TRMM 2A25 data are estimates of the three-dimensional distribution of rain from the TRMM Precipitation Radar. The average rainfall rate between two pre-defined altitudes is calculated for each beam position. Other output data include parameters of Z-R relationships, integrated rain rate of each beam, range bin numbers of rain layer boundaries, and many intermediate parameters. Iguchi and Meneghini (1994) describe this algorithm.

Statistics of the monthly rainfall, including number of samples, standard deviation, goodness-of-fit (of the brightness temperature histogram to the lognormal rainfall distribution function) and rainfall probability are also included in the output for each grid box.

TMI brightness temperature histograms at 1 degree intervals are generated based on the 19, 21 and 19-21 GHz combination channels obtained from the Level 1B (calibrated brightness temperature) TMI product. Monthly rainfall indices over the ocean are derived by statistically matching monthly histograms of brightness temperatures with model calculated rainfall Probability Distribution Functions (PDF) using the 19-21 GHz combination data.

This land sea mask originated from the NOAA group at SSEC in the 1980s. It was originally produced at 1/6 deg resolution, and then regridded for the purposes of GPCP, TMPA, and IMERG precipitation products. NASA code 610.2, Global Change Data Center, restructured this TMPA land sea mask to match the TMPA  grid, and converted the file to CF-compliant netCDF4. Version 2 was created in May, 2019 to resolve detected inaccuracies in coastal regions.

Users should be aware that this is a static mask, i.e. there is no seasonal or annual variability, and it is due for update. It is not recommended to be used outside of the aforementioned precipitation data.</description>

                <description>As part of the NASA's Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program, this project entitled &#8220;Multi-Decadal Nitrogen Dioxide and Derived Products from Satellites (MINDS)&#8221; will develop consistent long-term global trend-quality data records spanning the last two decades, over which remarkable changes in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions have occurred. The objective of the project Is to adapt Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) operational algorithms to other satellite instruments and create consistent multi-satellite L2 and L3 nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns and value-added L4 surface NO2 concentrations and NOx emissions data products, systematically accounting for instrumental differences. The instruments include Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME, 1996-2011), SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY, 2002-2012), OMI (2004-present), GOME-2 (2007-present), and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI, 2018-present). The quality assured L2-L4 products will be made available to the scientific community via the NASA GES DISC website in Climate and Forecast (CF)-compliant Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) and netCDF formats.</description>

                <description>AMSR-E/Aqua surface soil moisture (LSMEM) L3 1 day 0.25 degree x 0.25 degree V001 is a global, 10-year (2002-2011) data set. It is created from soil moisture retrieved from passive microwave brightness temperatures measured by the 10.65 and 36.5 GHz radiometers on the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor on the NASA Aqua satellite. The retrieval algorithm is based on Princeton's Land Surface Microwave Emission Model (LSMEM), a physically-based radiative transfer model, and serves as the core algorithm in the estimation procedure. To retrieve surface soil moisture, two unknowns, the soil moisture and the effective vegetation optical depth, are simultaneously solved from two radiative transfer equations in LSMEM, one for the 10.65 GHz horizontally-polarized brightness temperature and the other for the 10.65 GHz vertically-polarized brightness temperature. The land surface temperature required in the estimation procedure is estimated from the 36.5 GHz vertically-polarized brightness temperature, using a regression relationship. This soil moisture product does not include areas covered by snow, so the snow model is not described. Also, the atmosphere is assumed to have constant brightness temperatures; therefore, the atmosphere model is also not described.</description>

                <description>SRB/GEWEX evapotranspiration (Penman-Monteith) L4 3 hour 0.5 degree x 0.5 degree V1 is a global, 24-year (1984-2007), satellite-derived evapotranspiration over land data set. It is based on the Penman-Monteith model. Evapotranspiration provides the critical link between the water and energy cycles within the Earth system. Better representation of the spatial distribution and temporal development of surface evapotranspiration is needed not only to improve the description of water vapor exchanges for global water budget estimation but also to advance our understanding of the climate system.

Input data sets include (1) vegetation index data, i.e., Leaf Area Index (LAI), derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors onboard the NOAA-7, NOAA-9, NOAA-11, NOAA-14, and NOAA-16 satellites and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the EOS-Terra and EOS-Aqua satellites; (2) meteorology data from the latest version of the Princeton University global forcing data sets and from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface model output; and (3) radiative data from the NASA Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) Surface Radiation Budget Project.</description>
