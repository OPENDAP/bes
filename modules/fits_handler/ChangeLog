2016-01-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated ChangeLog, etc., for the bes 3.17 release

2015-12-28  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Patched error handling problems in Transmitter implmentations. In particular: 
	1) Ensured that libdap::Error objects are converted to BESDapError objects 
	when caught. and 2) Catch and rethrow BESError objects whenever they could 
	be thrown so they don't get swept up as unidentified errors in a catch(...)
	clause.

	distcheck fix

2015-10-01  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Committing changes (mostly to bes.conf.in files) in support of
	changing ubiquitos use of BES.CacheDir, BES.CachePrefix, and
	BES.CacheSize to specifically reference the decompression
	cache (which is waht it actually is) so as to avoid cache
	configuration collisions with various handlers that also were
	utilizing teh same cache with different expectations. Now, by
	calling these BES keys BES.UncompressCache.dir,
	BES.UncompressCache.prefix, and BES.UncompressCache.size we
	specifically isolate the decompression cache configuration from
	the other caches.

	number.

	Fix for the bug where info responses were not working for some of the datasets. The problem turned out to be that the cfitsio library seems to treat TLONG not as a 32-bit int but as a 64-bit int. Image that were typed 'long' were being read into an array of 32-bit ints and that was overwriting memory. I added 12 tests, including some for datasets that triggered this bug.

2006-11-02  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	ConstraintEvaluator is now a part of the BESDDSResponse and
	BESDataDDSResponse classes instead of BESDataHandlerInterface. Any
	Error exceptions need to be caught in the request handlers and
	converted into BESHandlerException, which is the non-fatal
	exception. Removed the building of a bes style cgi application,
	building only the typical dap style cgi application.

	--without-bes now works for the different handler directories as
	well as for the dap-server directory. cedar-handler requires bes. If
	--without-bes is not specified then either --with-bes is looked at
	if specified, or the bes-config script is looked for.

	Changed the _module library to not use version information and to be
	built as a module. Update the bes.m4 file to use the --modulesdir
	flag to bes-config to get the name of the module directory, which is
	lib/bes.  Updated bes.m4 to be like the other handlers bes.m4.

	fits_read_attributes. In fits_read_descriptors added the dataset
	name to the dds and data dds so that client applications could parse
	it.
