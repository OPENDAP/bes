BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

0) Please skim REQUIREMENTS and NOTES sections of this file before reporting
   problems. Thanks.

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
   type `sh configure.' If you want this part of the server to install
   someplace other than /usr/local/bin, use --prefix to change the prefix
   from the default "/use/local/." Make sure that the dap-server CGI knows
   where the handler is located (you can list the complete pathname in the
   dap-server.rc file; see dap-server's INSTALL and README files).

2) Type `make' to build the three server programs

3) Install the server components in $prefix by running `make install.'

Building from Our SVN Repository

  If you are building from a SVN checkout, run 'autoreconf --verbose' before
  './configure; make'. If you try to run autoconf, et c., by hand and wind up
  with build files that don't work, use 'autoreconf --force --verbose'. Once
  autoreconf has made the configure and Makefile.in files, do ./configure;
  make; make install as outlined above.

REQUIREMENTS

  o You need the libdap library version 3.11.0 and the BES software,
    version 3.9.0, to build and install this software. If you're using
    Linux, this means either building form source or using the libdap,
    libdap-devel, bes and bes-devel RPM packages.

  o You also need a recent copy of cfitsio. We've tested this server with
    cfitsio version 3.0, although any recent version should work fine. If the
    configure script cannot find your copy of libcfitsio, use the
    --with-cfits options to tell it where to look (see configure --help).

  o You should have gcc/g++ 3.3.x or greater. You'll also need to get
    the stdc++ library that matches the compiler (whatever version).
    NB: gcc 2.8.x and earlier *won't* build the software. We're
    working on modifying the software so that it will build with a
    variety of compilers. As of 01/22/03 we have built the code using
    Microsoft's Visual C++ 6.0 and GNU gcc/++ 3.2.1, 3.3, 3.4 and 4.0.
    This code has also been built on OSX 10.9 using Apple LLVM version
    5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn).
