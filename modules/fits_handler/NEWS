This version of the Fits handler includes an executable for use with
Server3 and a shared-object library (aka module) for use with Server4. This
is a source release to support the Server4 1.2 beta release and has not been
tested with Server3, although there should be no problems.

This version also builds an executable for use with Server3 using Server4
BES code. This executable is not installed.

This software has been built using gcc 3.2.3 and gcc 4.0.1. It requires the
user of autoconf 2.59 or newer and was built using automake 1.9.6.
