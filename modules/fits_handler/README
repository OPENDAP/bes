Updated for Version 1.0.11

This is the OPeNDAP fits Data Handler. It is used along with OPeNDAP's
Hyrax data server.

For information about building the OPeNDAP Data Handler, see the
INSTALL file.

This data handler is a component of the OPeNDAP DAP Server; the server base
software is designed to allow any number of handlers to be configured easily.
See the DAP Server README and INSTALL files for information about
configuration, including how to use this handler.

Note that the BES has separate configuration files for each of its
modules and the one for this handler is called fits.conf. It will be
made automatically by the configure script and installed for you in
$prefix/etc/bes/modules. You can edit this file to suit your needs.
   
Test data are also installed, so after installing this handler, Hyrax
will have data to serve providing an easy way to test your new
installation and to see how a working bes.conf should look. To use
this, make sure that you first install the bes. Finally, every time
you install or reinstall handlers, make sure to restart the BES and
OLFS.
