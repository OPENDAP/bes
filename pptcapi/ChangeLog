	Includes required on linux for pptcapi_test. Wasn't creating header
	buffer big enough in send.
	M    pptcapi/testsuite/pptcapi_test.c
	M    pptcapi/pptcapi_send.c

2008-08-28  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	The version reported was for the BES package. Changed to pptcapi
	M    pptcapi-config.in

2008-08-15  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	tcp window tuning is now provided in the tcp connection call. The
	user is allowed to set the tcp window sizes for buffer sizes by
	passing the receive and send buffer sizes to the tcp connection
	call. The system call setsockopt is used to set the buffer sizes on
	the connection socket. If set to 0 then the current buffer sizes are
	used by calling getsockopt.

	Added debugging calls to the code, user can now turn on and turn off
	debugging if desired.

	Fixed the problem where the receive chunk size is bigger than the
	receive buffer size while creating a static buffer to use in the
	receive calls. This will eliminate fragmentation caused by
	allocating new buffers for each call to receive.

	Added pptcapi.m4 that can be copied to other projects if needed, or used
	from the installation aclocal directory.
	A    pptcapi/conf/pptcapi.m4
	M    pptcapi/Makefile.am

2008-07-17  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Added macros to help define error conditions. Added error checking
	to the code documentation and to the test client pptcapi_test.c
	M    pptcapi/pptcapi.h
	M    pptcapi/testsuite/pptcapi_test.c

2008-07-17  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Need to free the buffer after each call to pptcapi_receive since it is
	created during each call the size of the chunk being received.
	M    pptcapi/pptcapi.h
	M    pptcapi/testsuite/pptcapi_test.c

2008-07-15  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Removed the declaration of initialize connection struct function
	from pptcapi as it is an internal function. Changed tcp_connect and
	socket_connect files to include external declaration of this
	function. Added lots of code documentation to pptcapi.
	M    pptcapi/pptcapi_tcp_connect.c
	M    pptcapi/pptcapi_socket_connect.c
	M    pptcapi/pptcapi.h

2008-07-15  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Updated to use 7 characters for chunk length. Fixed problem where
	receive was using a buffer too small in the call to read. The buffer
	is now dynamically created depending on the chunk size. Updated the
	test results because problem fixed in BES data handlers where
	ancillary data wasn't being read. Modified the send and receive code
	to use macro definitions of the chunk so that all we have to do is
	change the macro definitions in pptcapi.h and won't have to go
	through the code to update (except in pptcapi_send where building
	the chunk header).
