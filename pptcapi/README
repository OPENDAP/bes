Updated for version 1.0.3 of the OPeNDAP BES PPT C API.

See the INSTALL file for build instructions.

For more information on the BES PPT C API please visit the OPeNDAP
documentation page for the BES PPT at
http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/Hyrax_-_BES_PPT. This includes information
about the PPT protocol, how to use the C++ and C APIs, and example client
code.

Contents

  * What's here: What files are in the distribution

  * About the BES PPT C API: What exactly is this

  * Configuration: How to configure the BES PPT C API

  * Testing: Once built and configured, how do you know it works?

* What's here:

There's a pptcapi-config script which will be installing in $prefix/bin that
can be used to determine where the libraries and their header files have been
installed. This directory also contains some documentation files.

conf: Where the automake and autoconf configuration files live

docs: Where some PPT C API documentation resides. Doxygen files get
generated here.

unit-tests: Unit tests for the PPT C API

testsuite: A regression test suite for the PPT C API to communicate with the
BES.

* About the BES PPT C API

* Configuration

There is no current configuration that is required to use the BES PPT C API.

* Testing

If you have installed the BES PPT CAPI from source tar ball or from svn you
can run some different make targets to test the software. Currently there is
no other way to test the software without writing some code. A sample PPT C
API client code is provided at:

http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/Hyrax_-_BES_PPT.

The first make target is 'make check', which will run some unit tests to
make sure that the different parts of the PPT C API are working properly.

The second make target requires that you have the BES installed with the
netcdf_handler module loaded. Once this BES is running on the default port
you can run 'make bes-pptcapi-tests' and it will run the test source code.

For starting the BES and installing the different data handlers please read
the documentation provided at http://docs.opendap.org.
