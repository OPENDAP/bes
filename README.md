README for the OPeNDAP BES 
==========================

# Updated for version 3.20.1. See NEWS

## Bug fixes for Hyrax 1.15

## Server function roi() improvments

## Site-specific configuration

The BES uses a number of configuration files, and until now, a site has to
customize these for their server. Each server installation would overwrite
those files. No more. Now you can put all your configuration values in 

> /etc/bes/site.conf

And be configent that they will never be overwritten by a new install. The
`site.conf` file is always read last, so parameters set there override values
set elsewhere.

## The MDS

A new cache has been added to the BES for Metadata Responses (aka, the MDS
or Metadata Store). This cache is unlike the other BES caches in that it is
intended to be operated as either a 'cache' or a 'store.' In the latter case,
items added will never be removed - it is an open-ended place where metadata
response objects will be kept indefinitely. The MDS contents (as a cache or 
a store) will survive Hyrax restarts.

The MDS was initially built to speed responses when data are stored on high-
latency devices like Amazon's S3 storage system. We have special features in
Hyrax to handle data kept on those kinds of data stores and the MDS can provide
clients with fast access to the metadata for those data very quickly. After
our initial tests of the MDS, we decided to make it a general feature of the
server, available to data served from data stored on spinning disk in addition
to S3.

Note: The MDS is not used for requests that using server-side function processing.

The MDS configuration can be found in the dap.conf configuration file. Here 
are the default settings:

* Setting the 'path' to null disables uses of the MDS. 

> DAP.GlobalMetadataStore.path = @datadir@/mds
> DAP.GlobalMetadataStore.prefix = mds

* Setting 'size' to zero makes the MDS hold objects forever; setting a positive 
non-zero size makes the MDS behave like a cache, purging responses when the 
size is exceeded. The number is the size of the cache volume in megabytes.

> DAP.GlobalMetadataStore.size = 200

* The MDS writes a ledger of additions and removals. By default the ledger is
kept in 'mds_ledger.txt' in the directory used to start the BES.

> DAP.GlobalMetadataStore.ledger = @datadir@/mds_ledger.txt

## COVJSON Response

For datasets that contain geo-spatial data, we now provide the option to
get those data (and related metadata) encoded using the covjson format. 
(See https://covjson.org/). Thanks to Corey Hemphill, Riley Rimer, and 
Lewis McGibbney for this contribution.

## Prototype support for data stored on Amazon's S3 Web Object Store

Hyrax 1.15 has prototype support for subset-in-place of HDF5 and NetCDF4
data files that are stored on AWS S3. Data files stored in S3 must be
configured for use with this feature of Hyrax. To configure files for use
with this feature, a special metadata file must be built and installed in
the MDS. For this feature, the MDS should be run in 'store' mode.

Contact us for details. We welcome feedback on this new feature.

The software has a known problem with requests for very large numbers of 
variables in a single URL. 

## Improved catalog support

It has long been possible to define 'catalogs' for data that reside on other
kinds of data stores (e.g., relational data base systems). The datasets defined
by these catalogs appear(ed) in the directory listings as if they are 
directories of data files, just like datasets that actually are files on a
spinning disk. 

We have generalized this system so that it is much easier to use. As an example
of new Catalog sub-system's ease of use, we have implemented a new module that
reads information about datasets from NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR)
and uses that to display a Virtual Directory for NASA data, where the hierarchical
relationships between data files is derived entirely from data read a CMR-support
web API.

This software is currently available in source form only - contact us if you
would like to extend the BES Catalog system for your own data collections. 
To build Hyrax with this feature enabled, build either in developer mode 
(./configure ... --enable-developer) or using the spepcial configuration option
--enable-cmr.

## For the HDF4 handler

* CF option: Enhance the support of handling the scale_factor and add_offset to follow the CF. The scale_factor and
add_offset rule for the MOD16A3 product is different than other MODIS products. We make an exception for 
this product only to ensure the scale_factor and add_offset follow the CF conventions.
 
 
## For the HDF5 handler
 
CF option:
1. Add the support of the HDF-EOS5 Polar Stereographic(PS) and Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area(LAMAZ) grid projection files. 
   Both projection files can be found in NASA LANCE products.
2. Add the HDF-EOS5 grid latitude and longitude cache support. This is the same as what we did for the HDF-EOS2 grid. 
3. Add the support for TROP-OMI, new OMI level 2 and OMPS-NPP product.
4. Removed the internal reserved netCDF-4 attributes for DAP output.
5. Make the behavior of the drop long string BES key consistent with the current limitation of netCDF Java.

# Updated for version 3.19.1

BESInterface/XMLInterface improved

Testing/Logging Improvements

# Updated for version 3.19.0

New Server function: range() This function returns the min and max
values of a variable and, for a vector, a boolean indicating that it
is monotonic.

GeoTiff file can now be aggregated.

See NEWS for more information.

# Updated for version 3.18.0

New features:

- hdf5_handler adds support for sinusodial projections.

- ncml_handler adds support for the aggregation and metadata 
  manipulation of remotely located datasets. This new capanbility
  utilizes the exisiting gateway_handler and allows the ncml_handler
  to aggregate anything the gateway_handler can read.

This release fixes a number of bugs:

- Improved error logging (as in errors now get logged)
    https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HYRAX-302
    
- Improved server side function response assembly repaired:
    https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HYRAX-352
    https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HYRAX-342

- Stopped prepending "nc_" to netCDF file out responses whose
  download filename begins with a digit:
    https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HYRAX-341

- Repaired various BES timeout issues.
    https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HYRAX-341

# Updated for version 3.17.4

Added support for cached metadata objects.

Server functions can now return multiple values using specially-named
Structure variables. 

The code now builds using gcc-6.

See NEWS for other details.

See the INSTALL file for build instructions, including special
instructions for building from a (git) cloned repo. This code can
build one of two distinct ways and that requires a tiny bit setup.

For more information on Hyrax and the BES, please visit our documentation
wiki at docs.opendap.org. This will include the latest install and build
instructions, the latest configuration information, tutorials, how to
develop new modules for the BES, and more.

This version has significant performance improvements for aggregations,
particularly those that use the JoinNew directive.

# DAP2 versus DAP4

The code on the master branch now supports both DAP2 and DAP4
responses, and the data format handlers do as well. Because of that,
it must be linked with libdap 3.14, not libdap older versions of
libdap (libdap 3.14 contains support for both DAP2 and DAP4, while the
older 'libdap' supports only DAP2). If you need to get the DAP2-only
version of the software, use the branch named 'dap2'. Please commit
only fixes there.

Each of the handlers, which can be built as submodules within this
code, also has DAP2 and DAP4 support on their master branch and a
'dap2' branch for the DAP2-only code.

# What's here:

Here there's a bes-config script which will be installing in $prefix/bin that
can be used to determine where the libraries and their header files have been
installed. This directory also contains some documentation files.

_dispatch_: This is where the bulk of the BES source code resides.
server: The BES server and standalone executables; build using dispatch
cmdln: A command line client which can communicate with the bes server.

_dap_: A module that implements the (OPeN)DAP access.

_modules_: All the modules that are part of a standard Hyrax distribution.
The configure script looks for their dependencies and only tries to build
the ones that can be built. Note that the HDF4 and 5 modules are pulled in
from separate _git_ repositories.

_xmlcommand_: The BES/dispatch software is a framework. The basic commands
recognized by  it are defined and implemented by software in this directory.

_standalone_: The 'standalone version of the server; used for testing.

_apache_: An Apache module, currently not part of the default build

_ppt_: The PPT implementation. The BES uses PPT for its communication

_templates_: A collection of source files which can be used as templates when
you write your own handlers/modules, et cetera.

_conf_: Where the automake and autoconf configuration files live

_docs_: Where some bes documentation resides

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Once the BES software has been installed, you will need to make a few
changes to the BES configuration file, which is the bes.conf located in
_prefix_`/etc/bes/bes.conf`. Module and handler configuration files will
be installed in the _prefix_`/etc/bes/modules` directory.

Only a few parameters need to be modified to get the BES up and running
for the first time. These parameters are located at the top of the
configuration file are are:

**BES.ServerAdministrator**
- set this to an email address that can be used for users to contact if
  there are issues with your installation of the server.

**BES.User=user_name**

**BES.Group=group_name**
- set these to a valid username and groupname on your system. We
  recommend that you create a username and groupname called bes that has
  permissions to write only to the BES installation directory. We'll
  need to write to the log file, and that's about it.

**BES.LogName=./bes.log**
- Set this to the full path and file name for where you want the BES log
  file to be written.

With this configuration you will be able to start the BES. No handlers
or modules have been installed yet, so you won't be able to serve data,
but the BES should run.

### Configuration for Hyrax

For the BES to run with Hyrax, additional changes will need to be made
to the dap.conf and dap-server.conf files, which are located in the
modules directory _prefix_`/etc/bes/modules`. The dap module should be
installed by default with the BES. If the dap.conf file is not found, be
sure that you have libdap installed. The dap-server module, known as the
General purpose handlers, adds responses for the DAP ascii response, the
DAP info response, and the DAP html form response. You will need to get
the dap-server module. You should see a dap-server.conf file in the
modules directory.

The changes required for Hyrax are:

**BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory** = _path_to_root_data_directory_
- Find the BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory parameter in dap.conf. Set
  this to the root directory of your data. If you're serving data stored
  in files, this is the place in the file system where those files are
  stored.

**BES.Catalog.catalog.Include**=;
- This parameter specifies what files/directories are included in the
  list of nodes in the catalog. The default is to show everything. After
  this parameter is looked at, the Exclude parameter is then looked at
  to see what files you might want to exclude.

__BES.Catalog.catalog.Exclude=^\..*;__
- This parameter specifies what files/directories to include in the list
  of nodes in the catalog. The default, shown here, is to exclude any
  files or directories that starts with a dot (.)

The only possible configuration parameter that you may need to change is
the one that maps a file to a data handler. This parameter is called
BES.catalog.TypeMatch, and is found in each of the data handler
configuration files, such as nc.conf. The default values should work.

The value of this parameter is a semicolon separated list that matches
the name you used in the BES.modules parameter with different datasets.
The BES uses regular expressions to identify different types of
datasets. In the example given in the file, any dataset name that ends
in '.nc' will be accessed using the netcdf hander (because the name 'nc'
is used here with the regular expression '.*\.nc'; note that the BES
uses regular expressions like Unix grep, not file globbing patterns like
a command shell). Since the name 'nc' was associated with the netcdf
module in the modules section, the netcdf module will be used to access
any dataset whose name that ends in '.nc'.

The regular expressions shown in the examples are simple. However, the
entire dataset name is used, so it's easy to associate different modules with
datasets based on much more than just the 'file name extension' even though
that is the most common case.

To test your regular expression for the TypeMatch parameter, or the
Include and Exclude parameters, use the supplied besregtest program.
Simply run besregtest to discover its usage.

### Installing a custom handler/module

By default, The BES for Hyrax comes with a suite of handlers that read
a number of data formats. However, you can install custom handlers that 
are not distributed by default. I'll use the SQL handler as an example.

Get the SQL  handler source code from http://github.com/opendap/,
making sure that the version supports Hyrax. Expand the tar.gz file 
and follow the instructions with the following caveat:
If you have installed the BES using a prefix other than /usr/local (the
default), make sure that the correct bes-config is being run. If you are
having problems compiling or linking the handler, try using not only
--prefix=... but also --with-bes=... when you configure the handler. 

#### Install the newly-built handler.

Once built, install the handler using 'make install'. This will install
the BES module and a configuration file to use for that module. Each
module will have its own configuration file. In this case it is nc.conf
and installed in the _prefix_`/etc/bes/modules` directory. The next time
the BES is run, this configuration file will be read and the netcdf
module loaded. No modifications are necessary.

## Testing

To test the server, open a new terminal window and start the bes by using
the bes control script besctl, which is installed in _prefix_`/bin`.
using the -c switch to name the configuration file. If the server standalone
starts correctly it should print something like the following to stdout:

```
    [jimg@zoe sbin]$ besctl start
    BES install directory: <prefix>/bin
    Starting the BES daemon
    PID: <process_id> UID: <uid of process>
```

Go back to your first window and run the bescmdln program. Use the -h (host)
and -p (port) switches to tell it how to connect to the BES.

```
    [jimg@zoe bin]$ bescmdln -p 10002 -h localhost

    Type 'exit' to exit the command line client and 'help' or '?' to display
    the help screen

    BESClient>
```

Try some simple commands:

```
    BESClient> show help;
    <showHelp>
	<response>

	...

	</response>
    </showHelp>
    BESClient>
```

Note that all commands must end with a semicolon except 'exit'.

Now try to get a DAP response using a handler you registered (the BES
supports a fairly complex syntax which I won't explain fully here):

```
    BESClient> set container in catalog values n1, data/nc/fnoc1.nc;
    BESClient> define d1 as n1;
    BESClient> get das for d1;
    Attributes {
	u {
	    String units "meter per second";
	    String long_name "Vector wind eastward component";
	    String missing_value "-32767";
	    String scale_factor "0.005";
	}
	v {
	    String units "meter per second";
	    String long_name "Vector wind northward component";
	    String missing_value "-32767";
	    String scale_factor "0.005";
	}
	lat {
	    String units "degree North";
	}
	lon {
	    String units "degree East";
	}
	time {
	    String units "hours from base_time";
	}
	NC_GLOBAL {
	    String base_time "88- 10-00:00:00";
	    String title " FNOC UV wind components from 1988- 10 to 1988- 13.";
	}
	DODS_EXTRA {
	    String Unlimited_Dimension "time_a";
	}
    }
    BESClient> exit
    [jimg@zoe bin]$
```

If you got something similar (you would have used a different dataset name
from "data'nc'fnoc1.nc" and thus would get a different DAS response) the BES
is configured correctly and is running. 

To stop the BES use the bes control script with the stop option:

```
    [jimg@zoe sbin]$ besctl stop
```

Note: Constraints and the bes command line client

Constraints are added to the 'define' command using the modifier 'with' like
so: 

```
    define d as nscat with nscat.constraint="WVC_LAT";
```

If there is a list of containers instead of just one, then there can be a
list of <container>.constraint="" clauses.
