README for the OPeNDAP BES 
==========================

# Updated for version 3.19.1

BESInterface/XMLInterface improved

Testing/Logging Improvements

# Updated for version 3.19.0

New Server function: range() This function returns the min and max
values of a variable and, for a vector, a boolean indicating that it
is monotonic.

GeoTiff file can now be aggregated.

See NEWS for more information.

# Updated for version 3.18.0

New features:

- hdf5_handler adds support for sinusodial projections.

- ncml_handler adds support for the aggregation and metadata 
  manipulation of remotely located datasets. This new capanbility
  utilizes the exisiting gateway_handler and allows the ncml_handler
  to aggregate anything the gateway_handler can read.

This release fixes a number of bugs:

- Improved error logging (as in errors now get logged)
    https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HYRAX-302
    
- Improved server side function response assembly repaired:
    https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HYRAX-352
    https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HYRAX-342

- Stopped prepending "nc_" to netCDF file out responses whose
  download filename begins with a digit:
    https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HYRAX-341

- Repaired various BES timeout issues.
    https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HYRAX-341

# Updated for version 3.17.4

Added support for cached metadata objects.

Server functions can now return multiple values using specially-named
Structure variables. 

The code now builds using gcc-6.

See NEWS for other details.

See the INSTALL file for build instructions, including special
instructions for building from a (git) cloned repo. This code can
build one of two distinct ways and that requires a tiny bit setup.

For more information on Hyrax and the BES, please visit our documentation
wiki at docs.opendap.org. This will include the latest install and build
instructions, the latest configuration information, tutorials, how to
develop new modules for the BES, and more.

This version has significant performance improvements for aggregations,
particularly those that use the JoinNew directive.

# DAP2 versus DAP4

The code on the master branch now supports both DAP2 and DAP4
responses, and the data format handlers do as well. Because of that,
it must be linked with libdap 3.14, not libdap older versions of
libdap (libdap 3.14 contains support for both DAP2 and DAP4, while the
older 'libdap' supports only DAP2). If you need to get the DAP2-only
version of the software, use the branch named 'dap2'. Please commit
only fixes there.

Each of the handlers, which can be built as submodules within this
code, also has DAP2 and DAP4 support on their master branch and a
'dap2' branch for the DAP2-only code.

# What's here:

Here there's a bes-config script which will be installing in $prefix/bin that
can be used to determine where the libraries and their header files have been
installed. This directory also contains some documentation files.

_dispatch_: This is where the bulk of the BES source code resides.
server: The BES server and standalone executables; build using dispatch
cmdln: A command line client which can communicate with the bes server.

_dap_: A module that implements the (OPeN)DAP access.

_modules_: All the modules that are part of a standard Hyrax distribution.
The configure script looks for their dependencies and only tries to build
the ones that can be built. Note that the HDF4 and 5 modules are pulled in
from separate _git_ repositories.

_xmlcommand_: The BES/dispatch software is a framework. The basic commands
recognized by  it are defined and implemented by software in this directory.

_standalone_: The 'standalone version of the server; used for testing.

_apache_: An Apache module, currently not part of the default build

_ppt_: The PPT implementation. The BES uses PPT for its communication

_templates_: A collection of source files which can be used as templates when
you write your own handlers/modules, et cetera.

_conf_: Where the automake and autoconf configuration files live

_docs_: Where some bes documentation resides

# About the BES

Note see http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/Hyrax
for the latest and most comprehensive documentation.

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Once the BES software has been installed, you will need to make a few
changes to the BES configuration file, which is the bes.conf located in
_prefix_`/etc/bes/bes.conf`. Module and handler configuration files will
be installed in the _prefix_`/etc/bes/modules` directory.

Only a few parameters need to be modified to get the BES up and running
for the first time. These parameters are located at the top of the
configuration file are are:

**BES.ServerAdministrator**
- set this to an email address that can be used for users to contact if
  there are issues with your installation of the server.

**BES.User=user_name**

**BES.Group=group_name**
- set these to a valid username and groupname on your system. We
  recommend that you create a username and groupname called bes that has
  permissions to write only to the BES installation directory. We'll
  need to write to the log file, and that's about it.

**BES.LogName=./bes.log**
- Set this to the full path and file name for where you want the BES log
  file to be written.

With this configuration you will be able to start the BES. No handlers
or modules have been installed yet, so you won't be able to serve data,
but the BES should run.

### Configuration for Hyrax

For the BES to run with Hyrax, additional changes will need to be made
to the dap.conf and dap-server.conf files, which are located in the
modules directory _prefix_`/etc/bes/modules`. The dap module should be
installed by default with the BES. If the dap.conf file is not found, be
sure that you have libdap installed. The dap-server module, known as the
General purpose handlers, adds responses for the DAP ascii response, the
DAP info response, and the DAP html form response. You will need to get
the dap-server module. You should see a dap-server.conf file in the
modules directory.

The changes required for Hyrax are:

**BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory** = _path_to_root_data_directory_
- Find the BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory parameter in dap.conf. Set
  this to the root directory of your data. If you're serving data stored
  in files, this is the place in the file system where those files are
  stored.

**BES.Catalog.catalog.Include**=;
- This parameter specifies what files/directories are included in the
  list of nodes in the catalog. The default is to show everything. After
  this parameter is looked at, the Exclude parameter is then looked at
  to see what files you might want to exclude.

__BES.Catalog.catalog.Exclude=^\..*;__
- This parameter specifies what files/directories to include in the list
  of nodes in the catalog. The default, shown here, is to exclude any
  files or directories that starts with a dot (.)

The only possible configuration parameter that you may need to change is
the one that maps a file to a data handler. This parameter is called
BES.catalog.TypeMatch, and is found in each of the data handler
configuration files, such as nc.conf. The default values should work.

The value of this parameter is a semicolon separated list that matches
the name you used in the BES.modules parameter with different datasets.
The BES uses regular expressions to identify different types of
datasets. In the example given in the file, any dataset name that ends
in '.nc' will be accessed using the netcdf hander (because the name 'nc'
is used here with the regular expression '.*\.nc'; note that the BES
uses regular expressions like Unix grep, not file globbing patterns like
a command shell). Since the name 'nc' was associated with the netcdf
module in the modules section, the netcdf module will be used to access
any dataset whose name that ends in '.nc'.

The regular expressions shown in the examples are simple. However, the
entire dataset name is used, so it's easy to associate different modules with
datasets based on much more than just the 'file name extension' even though
that is the most common case.

To test your regular expression for the TypeMatch parameter, or the
Include and Exclude parameters, use the supplied besregtest program.
Simply run besregtest to discover its usage.

### Installing a custom handler/module

By default, The BES for Hyrax comes with a suite of handlers that read
a number of data formats. However, you can install custom handlers that 
are not distributed by default. I'll use the SQL handler as an example.

Get the SQL  handler source code from http://github.com/opendap/,
making sure that the version supports Hyrax. Expand the tar.gz file 
and follow the instructions with the following caveat:
If you have installed the BES using a prefix other than /usr/local (the
default), make sure that the correct bes-config is being run. If you are
having problems compiling or linking the handler, try using not only
--prefix=... but also --with-bes=... when you configure the handler. 

#### Install the newly-built handler.

Once built, install the handler using 'make install'. This will install
the BES module and a configuration file to use for that module. Each
module will have its own configuration file. In this case it is nc.conf
and installed in the _prefix_`/etc/bes/modules` directory. The next time
the BES is run, this configuration file will be read and the netcdf
module loaded. No modifications are necessary.

## Testing

To test the server, open a new terminal window and start the bes by using
the bes control script besctl, which is installed in _prefix_`/bin`.
using the -c switch to name the configuration file. If the server standalone
starts correctly it should print something like the following to stdout:

```
    [jimg@zoe sbin]$ besctl start
    BES install directory: <prefix>/bin
    Starting the BES daemon
    PID: <process_id> UID: <uid of process>
```

Go back to your first window and run the bescmdln program. Use the -h (host)
and -p (port) switches to tell it how to connect to the BES.

```
    [jimg@zoe bin]$ bescmdln -p 10002 -h localhost

    Type 'exit' to exit the command line client and 'help' or '?' to display
    the help screen

    BESClient>
```

Try some simple commands:

```
    BESClient> show help;
    <showHelp>
	<response>

	...

	</response>
    </showHelp>
    BESClient>
```

Note that all commands must end with a semicolon except 'exit'.

Now try to get a DAP response using a handler you registered (the BES
supports a fairly complex syntax which I won't explain fully here):

```
    BESClient> set container in catalog values n1, data/nc/fnoc1.nc;
    BESClient> define d1 as n1;
    BESClient> get das for d1;
    Attributes {
	u {
	    String units "meter per second";
	    String long_name "Vector wind eastward component";
	    String missing_value "-32767";
	    String scale_factor "0.005";
	}
	v {
	    String units "meter per second";
	    String long_name "Vector wind northward component";
	    String missing_value "-32767";
	    String scale_factor "0.005";
	}
	lat {
	    String units "degree North";
	}
	lon {
	    String units "degree East";
	}
	time {
	    String units "hours from base_time";
	}
	NC_GLOBAL {
	    String base_time "88- 10-00:00:00";
	    String title " FNOC UV wind components from 1988- 10 to 1988- 13.";
	}
	DODS_EXTRA {
	    String Unlimited_Dimension "time_a";
	}
    }
    BESClient> exit
    [jimg@zoe bin]$
```

If you got something similar (you would have used a different dataset name
from "data'nc'fnoc1.nc" and thus would get a different DAS response) the BES
is configured correctly and is running. 

To stop the BES use the bes control script with the stop option:

```
    [jimg@zoe sbin]$ besctl stop
```

Note: Constraints and the bes command line client

Constraints are added to the 'define' command using the modifier 'with' like
so: 

```
    define d as nscat with nscat.constraint="WVC_LAT";
```

If there is a list of containers instead of just one, then there can be a
list of <container>.constraint="" clauses.
