Note: opendapserver is currently not linked to any data types, such as cedar or
netcdf. No requests will be completed by this server until the Makefile is
modified to include a data type server.

Note: opendapserver authentication is currently set to test_autnethicate, which
means no authentication is done.

TTD: Write a configuration script that will configure the opendapserver
server to link in data type servers, such as cedar or netcdf.

For an example see the runconfig script in this directory.
