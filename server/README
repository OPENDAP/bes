Note: xdods is currently not linked to any data types, such as cedar or
netcdf. No requests will be completed by this server until the Makefile is
modified to include a data type server.

Note: xdods authentication is currently set to test_autnethicate, which
means no authentication is done.

TTD: Write a configuration script that will configure the xdods server to
link in data type servers, such as cedar or netcdf.

For an example see the Makefile in dispatch, which creates a test program
dispatch_test that uses cedar as the data type server. This will show what
is needed.
