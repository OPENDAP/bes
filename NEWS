News Version 3.2.1

The spec file now does not list gzip and bzip2 as required. You only need them
to serve compressed files.

The bes.conf.in file used 'hdf4' in some places and 'h4' in others. This meant
that lazy people like me ;-) who didn't read what they were doing but just
blindly uncommented lines were confused. I editied the file to use the same
identifier in all places. jimg.

News Version 3.2.0

Created bes control script besctl for starting, stopping, restarting, and
checking the status of the bes daemon and listener processes.

Executibles are again in $prefix/bin instead of sbin and have been renamed
besdaemon and beslistener. The bescmdln is also in $prefix/bin.

Modules dynamically loaded by the bes should now be built with the
-avoid-version and -module flags in LDFLAGS. This will not put version
information in the module names themselves. All modules should be of the
form xxx_module

dap-server now has bes support for getting ascii, info, and html responses
from the bes. Check the README for both bes and dap-server for these
updates. To use these modules, simply add ascii_module, usage_module and
www_module to the list of modules for bes to load.

Modules are now names using the name from the configuration file. The data
types are also named using the name in the BES.modules list. For example,
for the hdf4_module if you use BES.modules=dap,cmd,h4 then the handler will
handle data of type h4. For example:

set container values c,hdf/test01.hdf,h4;

BES will then look for the data handler h4 to be loaded.

Transmitter code (derived classes of BESTransmitter) only handle BESInfo
objects. For additional types of response objects, such as the OpeNDAP
responses das, dds, data, etc... developers will register functions with the
different transmitters to handle those types. See BESDapTransmit for
examples.

News Version 3.1.1

The old killdods script has been renamed 'stopbes' and the build files have
been fixed so that the script is installed in $prefix/sbin.

The dap_cmd module is now named dap_cmd_module to follow the pattern set for
the other modules.

The bes.conf file in dispatch/bes is now a generated file with some of the
paths filled in based on $prefix. The file also contains sample text for
three common data handlers.

Fixes to the XML output/response formats. See ChangeLog

Fixes to the exception notifications. See ChangeLog.
