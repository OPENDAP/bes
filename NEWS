News for version 1.3.0

Many bug fixes - see ChangeLog

Updates for the new versions of libdap and bes - this is important since the
new libdap constraint evaluator now works with Arrays of Structures.

The SHORT_PATH compilation option now has shorter reference names.

Grids are now generated instead of Arrays for Aura Swath data.

Int64 now throws an exception; DAP 3.3 will have an Int64 type.

Signed Byte is now mapped to Int16 (both the DAS and DDS).

If compiled with the CF option then the NC_GLOBAL attribute is produced if
a valid Grid projection in NASA EOS AURA file is detected. Resolution, min and
max attributes for lat/lon are extracted from structMetadata.

News for version 1.2.0

Support for NASA EOS Grid variables has been added to the handler. See
the README and INSTALL_EOS5_GRID files. You will need to use some
special options when configuring the handler's build in order to get
these features.

News for version 1.1.0

This version of the hdf5 data handler can be used with both server3 and
Server4. The handler is really an alpha version of software which NASA has
just agreed to fund via their ACCESS program. This code is being released in
the hope it will be useful, but data providers must be aware that it is not
complete in that not every valid HDF5 file can be served using it. See the
README for more information.
