News for version 1.1

This version of the hdf5 data handler can be used with both server3 and
Server4. The handler is really an alpha version of software which NASA has
just agreed to fund via their ACCESS program. This code is being released in
the hope it will be useful, but data providers must be aware that it is not
complete in that not every valid HDF5 file can be served using it. See the
README for more information.
