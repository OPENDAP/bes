Version 3.1.1

The old killdods script has been renamed 'stopbes' and the build files have
been fixed so that the script is installed in $prefix/sbin.

The dap_cmd module is now named dap_cmd_module to follow the pattern set for
the other modules.

The bes.conf file in dispatch/bes is now a generated file with some of the
paths filled in based on $prefix. The file also contains sample text for
three common data handlers.

Fixes to the XML output/response formats. See ChangeLog

Fixes to the exception notifications. See ChangeLog.
