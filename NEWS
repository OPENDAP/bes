Created for version 3.5.0

This version of the software has been converted to work with the 3.5.x version
of the OPeNDAP data server.

It uses automake and includes a spec file that can be used to build RPM
packages.

Some of the test files have been modified because they included images 
compressed using a lossy algorithm (JPEG). It's hard to verify that the 
values in the files are correct, so I've removed those from the files.

An issue with HDF 4.2r1 and earlier versions of HDF4 has been discovered. In
some cases a file written using an older vesion of HDF4 that contains CHAR8
or UCHAR8 SDSs may not be correctly represented as a DAP2 Grid. Instead it
show up as an Array.
