Version 3.5.0

This handler can return the DDX response (which is an experimental feature,
not to be relied upon).

This version of the software has been converted to work with the 3.5.x version
of the OPeNDAP data server.

It uses automake and includes a spec file that can be used to build RPM
packages.

Some of the test files have been modified because they included images 
compressed using a lossy algorithm (JPEG). It's hard to verify that the 
values in the files are correct, so I've removed those from the files.

Known problems:

An issue with HDF 4.2r1 and earlier versions of HDF4 has been discovered. In
some cases a file written using an older vesion of HDF4 that contains CHAR8
or UCHAR8 SDSs may not be correctly represented as a DAP2 Grid. Instead it
show up as an Array.

Bug #61: Vlens (which are one-dimensional arrays with an undeclared length
and cannot be subsampled) appear as Sequences. In version 3.4 access to
these using the [] array access notation was broken. Requesting [0:4] returned 
the first four elements, not the first five. That problem has been fixed, but
the larger issue of representing vlens as sequences has not. 

Bug #71: The dot (.) character is 'overloaded' in that it can be both a 
separater and a regular character in an identifier. If a Structure name 
contains a dot, trying to access a field using 'name.field' breaks since
'name' contians a dot itself and the parser thinks it's a separator. The 
fix for this will be introduced in DAP3. Until then, use the shorthand 
variable referencing notation where a field is requested using the
unqualified field name.
