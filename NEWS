## News for 3.21.0

Reworked the way we implement the BES's singletons (or more of them at least)
so that they use the Meyers Singleton pattern. This includes the EffectiveUrlCache
and TheBESKeys classes.

We have made significant advances to supporting HDF5 files in the DMR++ builder
and interpreter. Our support is close to complete with only a very few features
not supported. This support now includes HDF5's Varying-length string arrays. The
software now also supports scalar strings in all their forms. Note that we also
added support for fixed length string arrays in the DMR++ builder and interpreter.

This version of the BES includes a new feature, dependent on the newest version
of libdap, that reduces the time needed to build NetCDF4 responses by a factor
of 10 or more when the variables in the response are not spatially subset (that
is, when all variables in the response are returned in their entirety). It is still
possible to subset at the variable level and get this performance boost. This is
the 'Direct I/O' feature added ti libdap. NOTE: To use this feature, you must
rebuild DMR++ files using the version of the DMR++ builder associated with this
version of the BES (or get_dmrpp tool from the hyrax-1.16.8-356 build).

We improved the performance of finding the effective URL for a data item when it
is accessed via a series of redirect operations, the last of which is a signed
AWS URL. This is a common case for data stored in S3.

We have added generic Memory and File caching, tailored specifically toward the
cases that arise when serving data from S3 using the DMR++ system.

The BES now has much better support for response size and time limits. Users are
warned about responses that are too large _before_ they are built and the BES
now exits gracefully when a response takes too long to build. The limits are
configurable.

We replaced a home-grown HTTP connection pool with a scheme provided by libcurl.
The two have equivalent performance, but the libcurl version is much easier to
maintain and might offer room for improvement in the future.

C99 compatibility improvements for the GCTP code in/used-by the HDF5 handler.
Thanks ti Florian Weimer  <fweimer at redhat.com> for those fixes.

We have added a BES module that can work with S3 using the DMR++ system. This
provides a data flow that is similar to the one we provide for Hyrax in the Cloud
as developer for NASA, but this new module does not make use of the NASA/ESDIS
CMR system to resolve 'NASA Granules' to URLs. This will enable other groups to
use the DMR++ system to serve data from S3.

We have adopted C++-14 as aggressively as we can, resulting in fewer lines of code,
better memory management and more efficient code.

We have moved more of the handlers to build/use DAP4 as the default response format
and build DAP2 responses from those. This reduces the amount of code we have to
maintain.

The BES can sign S3 URLs using the AWS V4 signing scheme. This uses the Credentials
Manager system.

The bundled grid() and geogrid() server side functions now support DAP4.

## News for 3.20.13

* Triggered a build to test new dependencies (hdf-4 and netcdf-4 updates).
* Improved error messages for the response is too big, and response tool too
  much time to marshall.

# -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
## News for 3.20.12

* Patched bug in HDF5Array.cc introduced by the std::vector refactor
* Added time.h header to ppt/SocketUtilities.cc


# -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
## News for 3.20.11

* Support for RHEL8
* Refactored get_dmrpp, application. Some features still broken but core
  functionality is working now.
# Continued general migration to C++11 coding norms.

* Improved support for more GES DISC level 3 and level 4 products
* Support for add the support of AIRS level 3 and GLDAS level products.
* Refactored project so that all of the code that depends on the gdal library
  is in a single module, modules/gdal_module.
* Retired use of auto_ptr.
*  Refactored timeout implementation and dropped the use of SIGALRM therein.
* Modified fileout_netcdf handler to allow netcdf-3 responses to be up to 4GB
  in size. This behavior can be reverted by setting FONc.NC3ClassicFormat=true
  in the BEs configuration (aka /etc/bes/site.conf file)

### DMR++ Improvements

* Various improvements for supporting FillValue in dmr++ lifecycle.
* Various improvements for supporting FillValue in dmr++ lifecycle.
* Improved support for arrays of type String.
* Fixed trusted url bug in DMZ parser.
* Added support for "empty" valuyes scalars with associated _FillValue metadata.

#### get_dmrpp Improvements
* Added support for S3 hosted granules to get_dmrpp
* Added regression test suite for get_dmrpp

### DAP4

* Added Map elements to DMR
* Modify the HDF5 handler so that DAP4 Coverages have Map
  elements. This support extends to a number of DAAC "specials"
  like HDF-EOS5

# -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
## News for 3.20.10

#### DMR++ Improvements

* Added support for the HDF5 filter Fletcher32 to the dmr++ creation and
  processing code.

* Implemented lazy evaluation of dmr++ files. This change greatly 
  improves efficiency/speed for requests that subset a dataset that
  contains a large number of variables as only the variables requested
  will have their Chunk information read and parsed.

* Added version and configuration information to dmr++ files built using
  the build_dmrpp and get_dmrpp applications. This will enable people to 
  recreate and understand the conditions which resulted in a particular
  dmr++ instance. This also includes a -z switch for get_dmrpp which 
  will return its version.

* Performance improvement: By patching Chunk::add_tracking_query_param() so
  that it doesn't do anything if no parameter is submitted we eliminated a
  very time costly regular expression evaluation that was being performed
  during the read operation for every Chunk. This improved read performance
  by a factor of 2-3 orders of magnitude!

#### Handler Updates

* Added new netcdf_handler configuration parameter:
  NC.PromoteByteToShort 
  Which, when set to true will cause signed 8-bit
  integer values to be promoted to Int16 (Because the DAP2 data 
  model does not support signed 8-bit integers)

* By default the NetCDF Fileout feature will ship with 
  FONc.ClassicModel=false 

* Added new configuration option to the HDF5 handler:
  EnableCFDMR=true which will allow the generation of CF compliant DMR output.
  
#### General Houskeeping

* Code organization changes to facilitate development
  and compilation on different platforms.
  - Moved functions into modules directory
  - Improved Test scripts to handle version string updates.
  - Changed libdap includ paths to "libdap/*.h" to prevent 
    include file collisions.
  - Started migrating to C++11 regex implementation (away from
    older less efficient GNU implementation) This is controlled
    by a compile time switch for now.


## News for 3.20.9

#### NGAP & DMR++ Improvements

* Trusted cmr (#485)
  - Modifying things into shape to use http::url anstead of std::string
  - Replaced strings with http::url objects
  - Moved AllowedHosts to http
  - Fixed implmentations of http::url::is_expired()
  - Switch RemoteSource constructor to shared_ptr
  - Changed the way that http::url interprets no protocol urls/
  - Fixed concurrency issues in EffectiveUrlCache

* Corrected usage statement for get_dmrpp
* Handle the "missing data" files in the NGAP system
* Update NgapApiTest to reflect changes in CMR holdings.

* Dropped useless call to Chunk.inflate() and added a state check to protect us
  from a CONTIGUOUS variable that is marked as compressed.
* Rewrote read_contiguous() with std::async() and std::future dropping the SuperChunk idea.

* First implementation of the new restified path with two mandatory and one optional path components.

#### DAP4
* DAP4 doesn't support DAP2 Grid. The code that handles the DAP2 Grid coordinates
  will cause some DAP4 coordinate variables under different groups to be ignored.
  So this fix ensure the code NOT to call the code that handles the DAP2 Grid coordiantes
  for the DAP4 case. (HYRAX-477)  
  
#### General
* Added GitHub Actions to bes.
* Stop parser EffectiveUrl resolution activity (#532)

* Fonc refactor
  - Added support for streaming netCDF3 files that do not contain Structures.
  - Fix a small memory leak in the history attribute code at the transmitter.
  - Add history attribute is added to dap4.
  - Add NC.PromoteByteToShort=true in the configuration file. This makes it consistent with nc.conf.in.
    Also it make sures the value of signed 8-bit integer to be correctly represented in DAP2.
  - Remove unused getAttrType function from FONcArray.cc.
  - Dropping throttle from Fonc_transmiter

* Added throttle to BESUtil::file_to_stream()

* Ensure the data value correctness for the classic model.
  - When encountering a mismatch for the data type mapping mismatches,an error will be generated. (HYRAX-467)
  - For the classic model, ensure the _fillvalue datatype to be the same as the variable datatype.

* Server handler refactor (#513)
* Fixing duplicate CF history entries (#504)

* Perform comprehensive check of datatype match and implementation of ensuring _FillValue attribute
  type the same as the variable type. (HYRAX-449)

* Added new implementation of temp file transfer code for fileout_netcdf (#498)
* Added config param Http.UserAgent (#493)

* Fixed netCDF-4 and compression information is missing when A DAP2 grid maps to three netCDF variables. (#490) (HYRAX-388) 
* Adds call to the ftruncate() function in the update cache files activity, unit tests for string replace_all()

### News for 3.20.8

#### NGAP & DMR++ Improvements
* The dmr++ production chain: get_dmrpp, build_dmrpp, check_dmrpp, merge_dmrpp, and
  reduce_mdf received the following updates:
  - Support for injecting configuration modifications to allow fine tuning of the
    dataset representation in the produced dmr++ file.
  - Support for HDF5 COMPACT layout data.
  - Optional creation and injection of missing (domain coordinate) data as needed.
  - Endian information carried in Chunks
  - Int64 support
  - Updated command line options and help page.

* Improved S3 reliability by adding retry efforts for common S3 error responses that
  indicate a retry is worth pursuing (because S3 just fails sometimes and a retry
  is suggested).

* Improved and more transparent error handling for remote access issues.

* Migrated the service implementation making parallel requests using multi-cURL to
  the c++11 std:async and std:future mechanism.

* Added caching of S3 “effective” URLs obtained from NGAP service chain.

* Implemented support for EDL token chaining.

* New implementation of ngap restified path parser that is (almost) impervious to
  the the key value content in the path.

* Implemented the SuperChunk optimization for mass acquisition of required, consecutive
  chunks.

#### BALTO
* Updated JSON-LD content of the server’s Data Request Form pages so that it is (once
  again) in keeping with the (evolving) rules enforced by the Rich Results page which
  is part of Google’s Dataset Search

#### DAP4
* AsciiTransmit supports DAP4 functions
* Group support in fileout netcdf-4

#### General
* End Of Life for CentOS-6 Support - It’s been a long road CentOS-6, but NASA has
  given us the OK to drop support for you just days before your nominal end of
  life. On to the next std::future.

* Dropped the “longest matching” Whitelist configuration key in favor of a multiple
  regular expressions configuration using the new AllowedHosts key.

* Consolidation of internal HTTP code and caching for all services. This means more
  consistent behavior and error handling everywhere the server has to reach out for
  something.

* Introduced log message types: request, error, info, verbose, and timing which all
  log to BES.LogName/. Each type is identified in the log and has a “fixed” format
  that can be reliably parsed by downstream software.

* Updated GDAL handler.

* SonarCloud and /or Snyk is now a blocking step for all Hyrax component PRs

* Our Docker images have been updated to utilize ncWMS-2.4.2 which is compatible
  with current Tomcat security measures. This means ncWMS2 is working again…

* Dynamic Configuration - This feature is currently a proof-of-concept idea and is
  disabled with a compiler macro. To become an actual feature it will need to be
  implemented in a much more thoughtful and efficient manner. Which we will be happy
  to do so if there is sufficient interest!

### News for 3.20.7

* Hyrax can generate signed S3 requests when processing dmr++
  files whose data content live in S3 when the correct credentials
  are provided (injected) into the server.

* For configurations that require Hyrax to authenticate to access various
  remote resources, Hyrax can now utilize ~/.netrc (or a netrc file may
  be specified in site.conf) and Hyrax will use the appropriate credentials,
  if they are present.

* The get_dmrpp script for dmr++ production has been enhanced with better
  configuration options and built in QC tests for inventory along with
  a simple value test.

* The get_dmrpp script will default to using a template string for the value
  of the dmrpp:href URL when a URL is not provided with a -u switch. This
  allows the URL to be injected later.

* We fixed a problem with fill values by converting the FillValue type to
  the data type of the associated variable.

* Fileout NetCDF has a new configuration key, FONc.NoGlobalAttrs that can
  be used to suppress global attributes.

#### hdf5_handler

* The CF option support is enhanced.

* Added support for correctly generating dmr++ files.

* Enhanced support to handle netCDF-4 like HDF5 files and general two
  dimensional latitude and longitude files.

See the modules/hdf5_handler/ChangeLog for details.

News for 3.20.5

Improved and fixed bugs in the the CovJSON response format
(contributed by Corey Hemphill  <hemphilc@oregonstate.edu>).

Added support for c++11 and c++0x builds including tests in
configure that look for those options and use c++11 over c++0x.
This works with the stock compiler on CentOS 6 .

We have added much more support for S3. Data can now be served
from S3 without transferring whole files (Hyrax supports subset
in-place) and without reformatting the data. This version of Hyrax
supports configuration of data already in S3 as well as files
still on spinning disk. See the README.md file in
bes/modules/dmrpp_handler/data

Performance improvements and bug fixes to the XML parsers.

Added a fix from Aron.Bartle@mechdyne.com.
Netcdf file responses were not compressed when they should have been
if the dataset had Structures. Fixed by patching FONcStructure as Aron
suggested.

We have added experimental support for STARE (Spatio Temporal
Adaptive-Resolution Encoding) as part of our work on NASA ACCESS
grant 17-ACCESS17-0039.

We have added support for Dataset crawler/indexer systems that
use JSON-LD as part of our work on NSF grant #1740704.

The FreeForm handlers now support regular expression matching
when looking for format file.

News for 3.20.4

Hk-351 Improved Jpeg2000 and GeoTiff responses.
HK-352 Improved Jpeg2000 and GeoTiff responses.

HK-22 Repaired maximum response size limits feature.

Ironed out a number of issues with sonar scan builds.

News for version 3.20.3

Multiple bug fixes (See ChangeLog for specifics)

HK-320 fixed - libcurl fails when called from the bes daemon on OSX

HK-275 fixed - bes cmdln tests fail on master for the Travis build

HK-285 fixed/completed - The BES Centos 7 RPM as packaged does not
support `systemctl enable bes`

Created docker build for debian packaging

HK-304 Created docker build for debian packages.

News for version 3.20.2

HK-40 and HK-247 fixed - Renaming dimensions using NCML now works correctly
for aggregations.

Added automatic generation of site maps, including 'virtual' catalogs.

HK-258 fixed/completed - Now the roi() function will work for variables with
more than two dimensions. If the roi() function's bounding box has a different
number of dimensions than a variable, it adapts, applying the b-box to the
dimensions that correspond and not constraining the ones that don't.

News for version 3.20.1

Added server side function 'bbox_comb' that provides a way to combine to
bounding box (with dimensions M and N, respectively) to a single bbox with
dimensions M+N.

Fixed the roi() function so that it's more flexible about the bbox dimensions
and variable dimensions (it allows some variables to have different dimensions
than the bbox - the extra/unmatching dimensions are now ignored).

Fixed the MDS install error in the RPM packages

Added support for continuous delivery for CentOS 6 and 7 and Ubuntu Trusty.

Added a BES catalog for remote directories visible using Apache httpd. Currently
in the developer build only.

Fixes for the DMR++ handler - it now recovers from the odd '500' errors
that S3 returns (about 1 in 6,000 requests). Some other bugs in teh DMR++
code were also fixed - see the ChangeLog.

News for version 3.20.0

For more information about the new features and bug fixes, see README.md

* Updates for the HDF4 and HDF5 handlers in addition to bug fixes for other
handles as noted in the README.md file.

* Site-specific configuration

The BES uses a number of configuration files, and until now, a site has to
customize these for their server. Each server installation would overwrite
those files. No more.

* The MDS

A new cache has been added to the BES for Metadata Responses (aka, the MDS
or MetaData Store). This cache is unlike the other BES caches in that it is
intended to be operated as either a 'cache' or a 'store.' In the latter case,
items added will never be removed - it is an open-ended place where metadata
response objects will be kept indefinitely. The MDS contents (as a cache or 
a store) will survive Hyrax restarts.

* COVJSON Response

For datasets that contain geo-spatial data, we now provide the option to
get those data (and related metadata) encoded using the covjson format. 
(See https://covjson.org/). Thanks to Corey Hemphill, Riley Rimer, and 
Lewis McGibbney for this contribution.

* Improved support for data stored on Amazon's S3 Web Object Store

Hyrax has been about to work with data stored on S3 by copying those datasets
to a local cache for some time. With Hyrax 1.15 we have added support for 
subset-in-place for HDF5 and NetCDF4 data files.

We welcome feedback on this new feature.

* Improved catalog support

We have generalized the BESCatalog system so that it is much easier to use. 
As an example of new Catalog sub-system's ease of use, we have implemented a 
new module that reads information about datasets from NASA's Common Metadata
Repository (CMR) and uses that to display a Virtual Directory for NASA data

This software is currently available in source form only - contact us if you
would like to extend the BES Catalog system for your own data collections.

* Bug Fixes

About 40 bugs have been fixed for this release. See README.md

News for version 3.19.1

Logging Improvements

- HYRAX-548: introduce copytruncate directive in besd.logrotate, 
  remove brute-force stop/start

- Log only one line per get command. This can be switched back to 
  the 'three-lines-per-get' mode. using compile-time switches. There
  is also a way to trace which calls to the LOG() and VERBOSE() macros
  are responsible for which lines in the log. And there is an ERROR()
  macro to call out that an error is being logged. See the ChangeLog for
  more information.

- As per the above, now, when logging is not verbose, there is only about
  one line per request (more for errors). Turning on verbose mode go back
  to the old way of logging where each (internal) command run by the BES
  is explicitly logged.

- Switched to ISO8601 date-time; UTC is the default.
  Can use local time in the logs using BES.LogTimeLocal 
  in bes.conf.  The old date format is still in the code and 
  can be used by #undef the compile-time switch ISO8601_TIME_IN_LOGS.

Bug Fixes

- Fixed the integration tests in bes/cmdln.  

HYRAX-248   	Fixed the GeoTiff and JPEG2000 responses; in some
		cases the raster output was upside down.
HYRAX-263	Geotiff output appears to have the latitude axis inverted.
HYRAX-283	fileout geotiff doesn't work for NCEP dataset
HYRAX-294	Make this function (scale_grid) work correctly when
		subsetting an array drops it down to 2D
HYRAX-309	Test the geo functions with real data
HYRAX-362	Make the GeoTiff (GDAL) handler work with NCML aggregations
HYRAX-432	WCS-2.0 war file/ deployment is broken
HYRAX-458	Use of mkstemp/mkstemps in libdap and bes is bogus
HYRAX-465	The bes (travis) build is broken
HYRAX-491	Missing single source of truth for supported Format
HYRAX-507	Fix double quote problems with WCS constraint expression eval
HYRAX-529	Hyrax fails to start using "service besd start"
HYRAX-547	FreeForm handler fmt file for ASCII data with two header lines
HYRAX-548	logrotate.d in the release 1.13.4 RPM restarts bes and tomcat every day

Developer fixes

Interface Refactoring

BESInterface/XMLInterface improved, easier to grok. This affects only
people who write modules for the BES. It does not affect the behavior
of the BES in any way.

Specifically, streamline the BESInterface and BESXMLInterface classes
and how the DataHandlerInterface object is manipulated. Removed unused
fields, renamed confusing fields, removed unused formal parameters.
Removed useless typedefs from BESInterface. Removed init and end lists
from BESInterface. (as they are not used). Simplified class field name
changes Improved formatting for BESInterface and BESXMLCommand.

Added the 'hello_world' module into the BES's 'developer' build so
that people using our developer documentation can reference a handler
that works with the current version of the BES.

We have also added the DMR++ handler (see modules/dmrpp_module) the
regular source distribution. This code is not built as part of the
regular build, but it is part of the 'developer' build.

All the autotest dirs are now named 'tests'

News for version 3.19.0

Handler fixes:
HDF4 and 5 Handler fixes - summarized in those projects' NEWS file

hyrax-263 GeoTiff response axis order is correct (fileout_gdal
handler).

Refactored the software used to serve GeoTiff files (gdal_handler) so
it no longer keeps the GDALDataset handle open. This code was keeping
the GDALDataset handle open across calls to the RequestHandler when
returning data responses and this breaks the NCML handler.

Server function fixes:
hyrax-281: The scale_array() server function now works with 3D arrays.

hyrax-294: scale_grid() works when the grids are subset to 2D.

hyrax-417: Determine axis order for scale_grid() and scale_array()
functions.

Tests for the (new) range() function. range() returns information
about the max and min values of variable - much more efficient than
downloading the whole variable. This function also tests if a vector
is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

General fixes:
There were several functions/methods that made temporary files
(and used mkstemps, et c. to do so). These were refactored into
just one function.

Unit tests for the code were made more usable (hyrax-391)

Tests for the 'file locking cache' sub-system were added.

make distcheck now works without the cumbersome env var for configure
on Centos 7 and ubuntu 14. Centos 6 is still in the dark ages.

Removed unneeded classes in the BES framework (hyrax-378).

News for version 3.18.0

Bug Fixes:

- Patched a number of problems with production rules for RPM builds.

- Fixed BESFileLockingCache tests.

- Repaired (at least some of) the broken BES error logging.

- Repaired a number if timeout issues in the BES.


Features:

- hdf5_handler adds support for sinusodial projections.

- ncml_handler adds support for the aggregation and metadata 
  manipulation of remotely located datasets. This new capanbility
  utilizes the exisiting gateway_handler and allows the ncml_handler
  to aggregate anything the gateway_handler can read.

- Restructured the BES to a significant degree in order to streamline
  release and development issues.


News for version 3.17.4

Bug fixes:

A bug with logrotate was crashing the server;

Hyrax-282 fixed (Aggregations crash the BES when a response as netcdf
or netcdf-4 is requested). This problem was actually that any Grid
subset so that only some of the elements are sent broke the netcdf
handler;

Patched the HDF4 handler code so that the source dist contains needed
testing scripts/templates.

News for Version 3.17.3

Added an in-memory cache for the handlers

Added a logrotate file to the rpm package

Added the Response Cache (which is really used for function responses only
at this point).

Fixed Hyrax-254. This bug caused random behavior when accessing
aggregations.

Fixed a problem with ASCII responses when one or more dimensions of an
N-dim array had only one element.

New edits for the HDF5 handler

News for Version 3.17.2

Minor changes for the source distribution (no changes to the software,
but a change to the build scripts).

News for Version 3.17.1

Added an in-memory cache that handlers can use to cache DDS, DMR, ...,
objects. The handlers have to be modified to use this, but the
performance benefits are potentially huge. See bes/dap/ObjMemCache and
the netcdf_handler for the code and an example of its use.

Server functions can now return multiple variables and have then
appear as discrete things without being 'wrapped' in a parent
Structure variable. They do this by using a structure name that ends
with '_unwrap'. This means that server functions can return values in
a way that is usable by clients built using the netcdf-library.

Patch for gcc-6 from Orion Poplawski.

News for Version 3.17.0

BES Error responses now better reflect the actual errors - constraint 
expression parse errors are reported as such, for example. The server
returns sensible error responses that the newly-modified OLFS can
interpret and use to send informative messages back to a (human) user.

The BES now supports a usable timeout feature along with the machinery
to accept the timeout duration from the OLFS using a 'context'. The BES
will (optionally) cancel the timeout period once data transmission starts
so the timeout covers only the BES's computation and not the time to 
send a potentially large response over a slow network. The context name
is 'bes_timeout' and the value is the timeout period in seconds.

New BES keys were added to control the timeout feature:
# BES.CancelTimeoutOnSend=true
# BES.TimeOutInSeconds=600

The BES now have a Timeout error code and uses a 'Timeout exception' to
signal that the current operation has exceeded the timeout period.

We've settled on multiple value returns using a DAP Structure. In the
BES/dap module we look for a Structure return with a certain name and
flatten it. Pretty crude, but it works and doesn't require much fancy
machinery. Rule: if a Structure's name ends with '_unwrap' then it will
be flattened.

Better support for doxygen (but sadly, not more actual documentation).

News for version 3.16.0

Major fixes/improvements to the caching code - Hyrax uses a number of
different caches. Now they are all correctly synchronized. Handler developers
should use bes/dispatch/BESFileLockingCache when they need to make a 
special-purpose cache for their own use. Contact us for details if needed. 
Note that caching function results will be redone in the next release.

The BES now supports multi-homed hosts with a new Key that specifies the
IP on which the server should listen (BES.ServerIP).

Fixed an issue where SIGPIPE was 'lost'. This fixes the mysterious
'runaway' BES issue that was happening sometimes, particularly when
a client was stopped while making a large request.

UUID library issues may now be behind us for good...

An obscure bug in the XML command processing code caused elements to 
be returned out of order in some cases. Fixed.

We removed the BES performance timing/testing data files and put them in
their own github project (opendap/bes_timing). This moves a number of
huge data files out of the bes project proper, reducing the time to run
git clone.

News for version 3.15.1

Bug fixes.

News for version 3.15.0

This version of the BES includes many build fixes including better
support for the 'standard' build where only need modules are built.
Thanks to Patrick West.

The code in bes/dap now frees data once it has been sent using libdap's
serialize() methods. This can result in dramatic reduction in memory
use. However, it requires libdap 3.15.0 or greater.

Combined with the above fix, other improvements in libdap in support of
parallel I/O and matching improvements in the NCML handler, Hyrax using
this version of the BES can build and return aggregations is less time,
with far less latency and much less total memory. These improvements are
directed at JoinNew aggregations.

News for version 3.14.0

This version of the BES incorporates all the 'standard' handlers
and includes support for DAP4. It requires libdap 3.14. Included in
this is the ability to build a RPM that, using some packages from the
EPEL RedHat/CentOS/Fedora repo, provides a binary release for all of
Hyrax. This version of the bes rpm contains the word 'NASA'; the plain
version still uses EPEL but does not contain handlers like gdal (used
to read GeoTIFF and JPEG2000) or HDF4 w/HDFEOS2. The handlers
included in the 'NASA' RPM include the gdal and HDF4/HDFEOS2 handlers.

The besd script has been fixed and is now installed correctly by the
RPM package so that the bes can easily be configured to start at boot
time.

The code now builds using autoconf 2.63; automake 1.11.1 and libtool
2.2.6. These are the versions found on a RHEL 6 machine.

Added server functions: tabular(), roi(), bbox(), and bbox_union() for
use with the new Swath Aggregation features.

The built-in 'dapreader' handler can now be used to reduce
interdependencies between handlers when writing regression and
integration tests.

* Other Updates to handlers

The asciival handler was updated so that server functions will now
correctly return ASCII responses.

The HTML form was patched using a contribution from LARC.

fileout_json now handles arrays of strings properly.

The fileout_netcdf handler has a contributed fix from NSIDC:

   Convert OPeNDAP Byte array data to NetCDF NC_SHORT The handler's
   output currently interprets unsigned Bytes from OPeNDAP as signed
   bytes (NC_BYTE). To avoid mis-representing data and retain
   compatibility with NetCDF3/classic we need to convert/output this
   data as a NC_SHORT.

   The existing test data for fits utilizes signed integers which
   shouldn't ever be a valid output from DAP2. The test data should be
   validated/regenerated and the test re-enabled.


* New handlers

Added the new w10n handler to support w10n responses from the server.

Added the ugrid subsetting function handler. This server function can
be used to subset an unstructured grid (aka irregular mesh) as long as
that ugrid matches the specification being developed by ASA, inc. See
the online documentation for more information at docs.opendap.org.
http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/Server_Side_Processing_Functions

* Handlers that support DAP4

csv_handler
freeform_handler
gdal_handler (geotiff, jpeg2000, other formats)
netcdf_handler
hdf5_handler
fits_handler

News for version 3.13.2

Changes to the cache software.

News for version 3.13.1

Fixed a bug where too many accesses to cached files would cause the
BES to 'hang'. The cached files were the result of uncompressing 
gziped files. This is the only change in this bug-fix release and the
ABI of the BES has not changed, so there's no need to update the 
handlers.

News for version 3.13.0

Two significant bugs have been fixed in this version of the BES. Trac
tickets 2176, 2158, 2139 and 2025 have been fixed. These correspond to
problems building the code under OSX 10.9, requests with really long
constraints, and a problem where the beslistener daemon failed to exit
after the front end asked it to. The latter problem could result in
'zombie' daemon processes that would not go away until the server was
shutdown. 

Also in this update: Updates to the copyright headers and a patch from
Ezequiel Lara Gomez for long options.

News for version 3.12.0

There are several changes to the BES for this release.

The DAP operations have been moved to their own module, reducing the 
amount of stuff hanging around in dispatch. Along with this change, new
functionality for server-side functions has been added to the BES's
DAP module. This supports, in conjunction with changes in the OLFS,
the function syntax developed by COLA and used by the FTDS server. The
BES can now run server functions and cache the results, providing a
way for clients built using the netCDF library client toolkits to
'open' such a URL and then make repeated subsetting requests against
the result of that function.

Note that libdap now supports new server function special forms that
provide a way to pass large arrays into the server as constants in the
constraint.

Also note that we've redone how server functions are defined, making
it simpler to write them correctly. The default set of functions is
now bundled in a separate module (see the 'functions' directory).

News for version 3.11.0

Added a new method to the BESDDSResponse and BESDataDDSResponse classes
so that the contained DDS/DataDDS object can be set/changed by a handler.
This is used by the GDAL handler so that it can use a version of DDS that
it has specialized.

News for 3.10.4

Merged to trunk; tagged.

News for version 3.10.2

Changed the way the RPM packages install so that the 'bes' group has
write permissions on both /var/log/bes and /var/run/bes. The latter is
not strictly needed, but might be useful at some point.

Changed the default port for the BES to 10022 dues to conflicts on CentOS.

Also, fixed the way the server checks for conflicts at runtime and made the
error messages more informative.

There is no version 3.10.1

News for version 3.10.0

Added support for the Hyrax Admin Interface (HAI). The server now
supports a set of commands that can be used to start and stop the
server; load/reload/edit the configuration files; look at logging
output; and toggle debugging output on-the-fly.

Added support for response size limits.

News for version 3.9.2

Bug fix in PPT released in this version.

News for version 3.9.1

The CSV handler was moved out of this component and made its own
handler, with all the stuff that implies (it's own RPM, source dist,
etc.). At the same time a new tool for building tests has been added -
look in the code for the dapreader classes. Email us for more
information.

Bug & Build fixes fixes.

The default location of the bes.log file is now $prefix/var/bes.log

Support for the DAP3.3 Keywords (an experimental feature).

News for version 3.9.0, 14 Sep 2010

Moved BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory parameter to bes.conf so users
have to edit only one conf file for initial configuration

Allowing for conf files to include any required module configuration
files to be loaded first. For example, if ncml module requires dap
module, then the ncml module can include the dap module so that it gets
loaded and configured first. Also takes care of a problem where a
configuration file is included multiple times.

Fixed a problem where when transmitting a response any exceptions were
being absorbed and a generic exception thrown in its place.

Various bug fixes released in this new version.

News for version 3.8.4, 24 May 2010

Bug fix. IPC bug triggered by an errant handler. Likely the cause of the
runaway process bug which could be triggered by crawlers.

News for version 3.8.3, 04 May 2010

Fixed problem in logging where the actual command being executed
wasn't being logged to the log file.

News for version 3.8.2, 06 April 2010

Fixed bug in BESKeys where = was adding to a definition instead of
replacing.

Logging the received requests to the BESLog log file. Was just saying
[xml document]

News for version 3.8.1, 11 March 2010

Fixed potential bug in BES Uncompression Cache code when failure to
uncompress a file and checking size of current cache.

News for version 3.8.0, 2 February 2010

Changed the way BES configuration is modified for the different
handlers. Before, changes were made using either a target to make (make
bes-conf), or running a script (bes-x-data.sh), or making changes
directly to bes.conf. This is no longer the case. The file bes.conf will
have miner modifications (administrator email address, user and group
BES should run as, etc...) and that's it. All module configuration will
be in their own files in the etc/bes/modules directory. The bes.conf
file will include module configurations in the directory that end in
.conf. Any files that end with .conf in that directory will be loaded.
This way, bes.conf will never need to be modified after installation.

The bes.conf files that are already out there will still work. This is
the new, preferred method of configuration and we recommend that you
move to this format.

Added a new besd script that can be used to run the BES at boot/reboot
using chkconfig on linux systems. Please see besd script for more
information and ask your system administrator about getting this
installed in the proper location.

Added a new command to test error handling by clients <showError type="x" />,
where x is 1-5 and represents the following:
1. Internal Error - the error is internal to the BES Server
2. Internal Fatal Error - error is fatal, can not continue
3. Syntax User Error - the requester has a syntax error in request or config
4. Forbidden Error - the requester is forbidden to see the resource
5. Not Found Error - the resource can not be found

Removed all old OPeNDAP CGI server 3 references and files.

DataDDX support added to the BES in the dap module.

Cleaned up doxygen documentation for the BES.

Changed all tests from dejagnu to autotest. Changed bes/dispatch unit
tests to use CPPUNIT.

News for version 3.7.2, 8 April 2009

Memory leaks fixed.

News for version 3.7.1, 16 March 2009

Many many memory issues resolved.

Fixes for constraint expression parsing issues.

The service interface is now supported.

News for version 3.7.0, 28 Jan 2009

The BES now supports TCP Wrappers (from a patch sent in by
Gareth.Williams@csiro.au - thank you).

In the past the BES used a SQL-like command language but returned XML
responses. This seemed odd, so we've adopted a new syntax where the BES
accepts XML documents as commands (and still returns XML responses). The XML
command/documents hold XML that will look very familiar to long-time BES users
but a big change is that more than one command can be included in the
document, reducing the number of messages needed to get many of the DAP
responses. The upshot is that the OLFS <--> BES communication is much more
efficient. 

TCP window tuning is now provided. The user is allowed to set the tcp window
sizes for buffer sizes by passing the receive and send buffer sizes to the
tcp connection call.

The BES Chunking scheme is now set to use a really big buffer if you want -
About 2 GB. There have been a number of fixes to the chunking code (See
ChangeLog and/or SVN for details).

News for version 3.6.2, 25 June 2008

Changed default buffer size in PPT to 65535. This should create fewer sends
and receives in the server and client code for responses making response
times faster.

Added a BESStopWatch class to help with timings between client and server,
and for any other debugging required in the BES.

Modified the BESReporter interface to allow for easier iteration through
containers in get commands.

Other minor bug fixes and enhancements to code and configuration. Refer to
the ChangeLog file for more information.

News for version 3.6.1, 11 April 2008

Bug fixed in new PPT chunking scheme

Other minor bug fixes and enhancements to code and configuration. Refer to
the ChangeLog file for more information.

News for version 3.6.0, 29 February 2008

Changed a parameter name in the bes configuration file for memory
management that contained a typo. If you receive an error "cannot determine
memory keys" then you need to update the parameter MaximunHeapSize to
MaximumHeapSize.

BES clients and servers now communicate using HTTP style chunking rather
than using terminating tokens. This greatly improves performance of the
clients and servers in that they no longer need to step through any data
received to find the terminating token. Please refer the release notes on
docs.opendap.org for Hyrax 1.4 for more information.

Exceptions/Errors have been re-written and consolidated. Changed the name of
BESException to BESError and now have only five derived classes for the
different types of errors (BESInternalError, BESInternalFatalError,
BESForbiddenError, BESNotFoundError and BESSyntaxUserError.) Each error class
has a type number associated with it to make it easier for clients to
classify the given error. Please refer to the release notes on
docs.opendap.org for Hyrax 1.4 for more information.

BES catalog and data access now includes an option to follow symbolic links
or not, similar to what is used in Apache.  In the BES configuration file
is the new parameter BES.*.FollowSymLinks=No|Yes If set to yes, then
container and catalog requests will follow symbolic links relative to the
document root. If set to no, then we won't follow symbolic links.

The response to a 'show catalog' request will return the elements of a
dataset (directory) in alphabetical order.

The 'set container' request now verifies the existence of the data container
whereas before it did not, leaving the error to be handled by the data
handler in the get command.

Added a new method to the container class to release the container. The
access method is used to gain access to the data container. For example, the
container may need to be uncompressed and cached. The release method would
release locks on the cached item.

Added a stand-alone application with a bescmdln interface for testing
purposes. Run just like bescmdln with the addition of a -c option for the
location of the BES configuration file to use. Can pass a command via the -x
option, or load commands from a file using the -i option, dump the output to
a file using the -f option, or run it interactively.

Added .pc files for package configuration.

Other bug fixes. Please refer to the ChangeLog for more details and the
release notes on docs.opendap.org for the list of tickets resolved in this
release.

News for version 3.5.3

New option to the BES control script (besctl) to specify the location of the
bes.pid file. This was needed for some binary releases as the prefix for
installation is /usr, but the pid files are located not in /usr/var/run but in
/var/run. If not specified, then it defaults to the prefix/var/run directory.

News for version 3.5.2

New options available to the BES control script (besctl) and therefor the
bes daemon and listener applications. The new options are:

-i <install_dir> -> installation directory of the BES
-c <configuration_file> -> location of the BES configuration file to use

hyraxctl script now available to run the entire hyrax installation. This
Hyrax control script uses the BES control script besctl to start and stop
the BES. Options passed to the hyrax control script are passed on to the
BES.

The BES now determines the location of the BES configuration file in the
following manner:
1. -c option passed
2. BES_CONF environment variable
3. Look in default locations /usr/local/etc/bes/bes.conf,
/etc/bes/bes.conf, /usr/etc/bes/bes.conf

The BES now checks the full path of a file/directory against the BES
configuration parameter BES.Catalog.<catalog_name>.TypeMatch. Before it
just checked the basename of the file/directory. This now allows us to
have TypeMatch parameters that include a directory name as part of its
regular expression. This was changed to facilitate the jgofs data handler,
where the file names do not have file extensions. For example, TypeMatch
could be something like "jg:.*\/jg\/.*;"

A regular expression test program is now available in the BES source and
binary releases called besregtest that will allow
administrators/developers to test the regular expressions specified in the
BES.Catalog.<catalog_name>.Include, BES.Catalog.<catalog_name>.Exclude,
and BES.Catalog.<catalog_name>.TypeMatch configuration parameters. Usage
is:

besregtest include|exclude|type "<regular_expression>" <string_to_test>

Multiple catalogs now works. If there is more than one catalog registered
then the request must include the name of the catalog followed by a colon.
For example: show catalog for "nc_catalog:/"; If there is only one catalog
then works as before.

Added context to debugging in the BESDEBUG macro. This allows us to turn
on and off debugging for different areas of an application, such as bes,
ppt, nc (for netcdf handler), h4 (for hdf4 handler), etc... For example:

BESDEBUG( "bes", << "some debug " << endl << someobj << endl )

Also modified the -d option passed to the bes control script (besctl) and
therefor the bes daemon and listener applications to take the name of the
debug file plus context to debug.

-d "./bes.debug,bes,nc,h4"

Uncompression of .Z (zip) files is now available along with the already
existing uncompression of bz2 (bzip2) and gz (gnu zip) files.

New regression test created under bes/cmdln to test netcdf, freeform,
hdf4, hdf5, and server side functions. Must have all of these modules
installed. To run the regression test you must have a BES running with the
above specified modules loaded, then go to the bes/cmdln directory and
type make bes-configuration-tests.

Updated the csv-handler example BES modules and the hello_world example
modules. In doing so updated the besCreateModule script and all of the
template files associated with it.

News for version 3.5.1

Ticket #928 fixed in ppt code to correct finding marker issue.

News for version 3.5.0

Decompressing data files and caching of the result has been completely
reworked. It's now faster and secure.

Now when the BES has only a TCP or UNIX socket specified in the bes.conf
file, it is not an error. Thus it's possible to configure the bes to use only
UNIX or TCP sockets. When using the BES with Hyrax, use TCP and run it behind
a firewall.

The BES was modified so that it's no longer possible to look at the contents
of the host computer's file system when asking for catalog information.

News for version 3.4.2

Added some security notes to the documentation and to the configuration file
(bes.conf). By default, data file decompression is now off.

Fixed a problem with dates for Last-Modified headers on Solaris.

Fixed some memory leaks 

News Version 3.4.1

Changed the name of the release from Server4 to Hyrax.

Added two example modules under bes.

The first is the hello world module, which adds a command 'say <something>
to <someone>;' For example, 'say hello to world;'. Adds a request handler, a
response handler, a new command (the say command), and a reporter to report
what is being said to who.

The second is a csv_handler, which can read comma separated files in a
certain format. This module adds a new request handler that can handle the
typical dap responses.

Minor bug fixes and clean ups. See the ChangeLog file for more information.

News Version 3.4.0

Added a new feature to the BES, the ability to create context within the
BES. This is done through a new command 'set context <name> to <value>; The
dap module uses the context feature when determining how to deliver error
messages. If the context 'errors' is set to 'dap2' then all exceptions are
converted into libdap Error objects. The method print is then called using
stdout. This way, dap2 clients can recognize errors.

Added a hello world example module. It does not handle data requests, but a
simple command to say something to someone. It shows the power of creating
your own module. In doing this, added besCreateModule and the templates
directory to the build. Updated these files. besCreateModule is a shell
script that is used to create a new module. Using template files, it creates
source code, based on a few questions asked. The developer then adds their
own code.

News Version 3.3.1

A new default command was added, 'get stream for <definition>' that streams
back the contents of the specified definition. A definition is created as
usual, using 'set container' commands and using those containers to create
the definition.

Modified the way the container creation works. Restrictions were put on what
files can be used in a 'set container' command. You can not specify ../ in
the path of the container. You must specify a new parameter in the BES
configuration file BES.Data.RootDirectory which points to the root directory
of any containers. This is used for file type containers only.

Created a BESDebug class to allow developers to run the server with debug
option. The option to use with besctl is '-d cerr|<filename>' to output any
debug to standard error (standard out is redirected to the socket, which
would go back to the client) or to the specified file. All BES classes are
derived from BESObj, where a dump method was added to dump the contents of
an object (private data members, information about the instance) and added
an operator<< so that developers can say strm << bes_obj << endl; and have
the dump method called on that BES object.

The BES now does not require libdap. Default responses, transmitters,
commands, etc... are available through the BES: showing help, status,
process id, version information, keys defined in the configuration file;
streaming files using the new command; creating, showing, and deleting
containers; creating, showing, and deleting definitions. All DAP specific
commands are now in a loaded module: retrieving the DAS, DDS, DDX, DataDDS
and a transmitter to handle transmitting those response objects.

A request to the catalog now includes an attribute for the node called
isData that is true if the file can be handled by one of the data handlers
registered with the server. For example, if the name of the node ends with
.nc and the netcdf data handler is loaded into the server, then isData would
be set to true.

News Version 3.2.1

The spec file now does not list gzip and bzip2 as required. You only need them
to serve compressed files.

The bes.conf.in file used 'hdf4' in some places and 'h4' in others. This meant
that lazy people like me ;-) who didn't read what they were doing but just
blindly uncommented lines were confused. I edited the file to use the same
identifier in all places. jimg.

News Version 3.2.0

Created bes control script besctl for starting, stopping, restarting, and
checking the status of the bes daemon and listener processes.

Executables are again in $prefix/bin instead of sbin and have been renamed
besdaemon and beslistener. The bescmdln is also in $prefix/bin.

Modules dynamically loaded by the bes should now be built with the
-avoid-version and -module flags in LDFLAGS. This will not put version
information in the module names themselves. All modules should be of the
form xxx_module

dap-server now has bes support for getting ascii, info, and html responses
from the bes. Check the README for both bes and dap-server for these
updates. To use these modules, simply add ascii_module, usage_module and
www_module to the list of modules for bes to load.

Modules are now names using the name from the configuration file. The data
types are also named using the name in the BES.modules list. For example,
for the hdf4_module if you use BES.modules=dap,cmd,h4 then the handler will
handle data of type h4. For example:

set container values c,hdf/test01.hdf,h4;

BES will then look for the data handler h4 to be loaded.

Transmitter code (derived classes of BESTransmitter) only handle BESInfo
objects. For additional types of response objects, such as the OpeNDAP
responses das, dds, data, etc... developers will register functions with the
different transmitters to handle those types. See BESDapTransmit for
examples.

News Version 3.1.1

The old killdods script has been renamed 'stopbes' and the build files have
been fixed so that the script is installed in $prefix/sbin.

The dap_cmd module is now named dap_cmd_module to follow the pattern set for
the other modules.

The bes.conf file in dispatch/bes is now a generated file with some of the
paths filled in based on $prefix. The file also contains sample text for
three common data handlers.

Fixes to the XML output/response formats. See ChangeLog

Fixes to the exception notifications. See ChangeLog.

News Version 3.1.0

This version of the BES is the first version to make it to a release status.
This is an release of the 1.2 milestone.
