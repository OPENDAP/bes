News for version 2.2.3

This version implement an option not to pass HDF5 file ID from DDS/DAS service
to data service since the NcML may not work when the file ID is passed.

Add the CF support for NASA GPM, OBPG l3m and MOPITT level 3 products.

News for version 2.2.2

This version fixes memory leak and improves performance by reducing the number
of file open calls.

News for version 2.2.1

Internal code improvments.

News for version 2.2.0

This version corrects dimension scale handling and archive metadata handling.
It correctly handles OMI products that have dimensoin names like "1" and "2".
It prints the file name instead of "virtual" in DDS output.

News for version 2.1.1

This version changes the _FillValue datatype to be consistent with the 
variable datatype.
This is not required by CF, however, netCDF-3 has this requirement.
This change makes fileout_netcdf work smoothly for some NASA products.

News for version 2.1.0

This version improves the performance of hdf5_handler in dealing with big files
with thousands of datasets.

News for version 2.0.0

This version is the re-engineering of HDF5 OPeNDAP handler CF option.
Please read README for what's new in version 2.0.0.

News for version 1.5.1

Fixed an issue with the IgnoreUnknownTypes option and a problem with
attributes that use hdf5's varying length string type.

News for version 1.5.0

Added H5.IgnoreUnknownTypes which follows the behavior pattern
established for/by the netcdf handler. When set, data types that cannot
easily be represented in DAP2 are simply ignored. When not set, an
error is returned when an unknown type is found in a data file.

The int8 to int16 conversion is now handled correctly.

News for version 1.4.4

Bug fixes (Aura MLS multiple swaths and variable names to follow CF
conventions.).

Partial support of handling multiple HDF-EOS5 swaths has been added to
the handler. It will only work when all swaths share the same
coordinate variables. The solution is mainly for handling Aura MLS
data. The robust and general solutions should be in the future.
	
Special characters inside the variable names are also handled by
replacing them with underscores. This was discovered by HIRDLS data.

News for version 1.4.3

Bug fixes (Grids, etc.) and fixes for the BES 3.9 and libdap 3.11 versions.

News for version 1.4.2

Bug fixes

News for version 1.4.1

Performance improvements when using HDF5 1.8

News for version 1.4.0

This versionof the handler contains many documentation and
dataset-specific improvements, particularly for datasets produced by
NASA. Support for HDF-EOS has been greatly improved.

Many fixes; see ChangeLog

News for version 1.3.5

This release includes bug fixes for handling HDF-EOS5 Grids and Swath
and supports more HDF-EOS5 products when --enable-cf option is
defined.

News for version 1.3.4

Repair to the --enable-cf and --enable-short-path options.

This release is a special release for Hyrax 1.5.2 that contains new
features added to the handler by THG for support of HDF-EOS5 data
files.

News for version 1.3.3

Somehow, the news didn't get updated...

News for version 1.3.2

Repaired memory allocation issues.

News for version 1.3.1

Fixes for the constraint, XML responses and service interface.

News for version 1.3.0.a

 The--enable-cf alone doesn't shorten the DDS variables.
 All variables will have the group path information. 
If you turn on --enable-short-name on top of --enable-cf,
it'll generate variables that starts with 'A??' where '??' is a unique
number. The --enable-short-name alone doesn't do anything.

  CoreMetadata will be parsed and provided as an attribute even if CF
option is enabled. We checked with IDV and GrADS and CoreMetadata did
not bother them so we think it's safe to turn CoreMetadata on always.


News for version 1.3.0

Many bug fixes - see ChangeLog

Updates for the new versions of libdap and bes - this is important since the
new libdap constraint evaluator now works with Arrays of Structures.

The SHORT_PATH compilation option now has shorter reference names.

Grids are now generated instead of Arrays for Aura Swath data.

Int64 now throws an exception; DAP 3.3 will have an Int64 type.

Signed Byte is now mapped to Int16 (both the DAS and DDS).

If compiled with the CF option then the NC_GLOBAL attribute is produced if
a valid Grid projection in NASA EOS AURA file is detected. Resolution, min and
max attributes for lat/lon are extracted from structMetadata.

News for version 1.2.3

When built using the --enable-cf and --enable-short-path, the handler was
dropping shared dimensions, breaking access using Ferret and GrADS.

Updates for the newest BES features.

News for version 1.2.2

Bug fix release reading map data from EOS Grid, please refer to the
ChangeLog file for more information.

News for version 1.2.1

DDX responses now contains attributes.

Package Configure (pkg-config) support added.

Support for HDF5 1.8.0 added.

News for version 1.2.0

Support for NASA EOS Grid variables has been added to the handler. See
the README and INSTALL_EOS5_GRID files. You will need to use some
special options when configuring the handler's build in order to get
these features.

News for version 1.1.0

This version of the hdf5 data handler can be used with both server3 and
Server4. The handler is really an alpha version of software which NASA has
just agreed to fund via their ACCESS program. This code is being released in
the hope it will be useful, but data providers must be aware that it is not
complete in that not every valid HDF5 file can be served using it. See the
README for more information.
