# The Http.No.Retry.Regex is used to exclude certain URL patterns from retry attempts
# This is useful for services, such as OAuth2 where certain redirect URLs contain
# "one-time" codes that may not be reused. Retrying these URLs will never work and doing
# so just makes the inevitable failure take much longer.

# Http.No.Retry.Regex=^https:\/\/.*\?code\=.*$
#
# Since many URLs result in a number of time consuming redirects (ex: OAuth2)
# We cache the "effective URL" for each to improve speed and reduce authentication churn
#
# Http.cache.effective.urls=true
#
# But we also know that many URLs (ex: AWS S3) will never redirect so we can skip the caching
# for those destinations. Any URL matching these patterns will not hae redirects followed
# and cached.

# Http.cache.effective.urls.skip.regex.pattern=^https:\/\/.*s3(\.|-).*\.amazonaws\.com\/.*$
