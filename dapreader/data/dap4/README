The file in d4-xml and dmr-testsuite were originally written for use with libdap
and were copied from libdap/tests/dmr-testsuite and libdap/unit-tests/D4-xml. 

The dap4.html will 'serve' the files.

To populate/update this directory with DMR files (text files that have
DMRs written in xml), goto libdap's tests and unit-tests directories
and run dmr-testsuite.tar.gz and D4-xml.tar.gz. Copy the tar.gz files
into this directory and expand.
