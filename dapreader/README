This module can be used by the BES to return DAP2 and DAP4 responses
using simple input files. There are two ways to create the input files.
The DDS & DAS or DMR files may be hand written and used to for both the
metadata and data responses (the latter use the Test* classes defined in 
libtest-types). Alternatively, the DAP2 or DAP4 data responses can be
written to a file (sans MIME headers) and used to build the DDS, DMR,
and respective data responses. These two options enable test code for 
handlers to use both 'synthetic' and 'real' datasets for testing without
requiring handlers (in the latter case) for given formats/data-stores
be loaded by the BES. In theory, you could use libdap, PyDAP, etc., to
build the data responses, although besstandalone is the probably easiest.

The handler will recognize files with the extentions: .dds, .das, .dmr, 
.xml, .dods, .data and .dap. Each extension means the obvious thing with the
addition that .xml is a synonym for .dmr and .data is a synonym for .dods.

TBD: Building DAP4 responses using DAP2 responses. This is possible, using
the DMR ctor that takes a DDS, but the code that ctor uses will not copy
data values, so there's some extra work to be done for the DAP4 data
response from a DAP2 data response.
