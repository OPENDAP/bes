This module can be used by the BES to return DAP2 and DAP4 responses
using simple input files. There are two ways to create the input files.
The DDS & DAS or DMR files may be hand written and used to for both the
metadata and data responses (the latter use the Test* classes defined in 
libtest-types). Alternatively, the DAP2 or DAP4 data responses can be
written to a file (sans MIME headers) and used to build the DDS, DAS, DMR,
and respective data responses. These two options enable test code for 
handlers to use both 'synthetic' and 'real' datasets for testing without
requiring handlers (in the latter case) for given formats/data-stores
be loaded by the BES. In theory, you could use libdap, PyDAP, etc., to
build the data responses, although besstandalone is the probably easiest.

The handler will recognize files with the extentions: .dds, .das, .dmr, 
.xml, .dods, .data and .dap. Each extension means the obvious thing with the
addition that .xml is a synonym for .dmr and .data is a synonym for .dods.

Note that while the DAP2 'response files' can be used to build both DAP2 
and DAP4 responses, the DAP4 response files (DMR & DAP4 Data) can be used
for DAP4 responses only. Also note that while DMR responses (and DAP4 Data
responses) contain attributes, the DAP2 data response does not. You can
put an ancillary DAS file/response in the same directory as the .dods (or
.data) file and the handler will merge those attributes into the binary
stuff moved around inside the BES. This is useful when the code under test 
needs data values and attributes, for example,in testing server functions.

Known issues: DAP4 data responses from DAP2 data response files that contain
Structures and Sequences may not work.
