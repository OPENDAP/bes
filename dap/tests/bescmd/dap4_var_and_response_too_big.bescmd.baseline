You asked for too much! 
    Maximum allowed response size: 10240 bytes.
    Maximum allowed variable size: 1024 bytes.
The submitted DAP4 request will generate a 3112656 byte response, which is too large.
In addition to the overall response being to large for the service to produce,
the request references the following variables that are individually Too Large for the service to process.

Oversized Variables: 
    Float64 /COADSX[180] (1440 bytes)
    Float32 /SST[12][90][180] (777600 bytes)
    Float32 /AIRT[12][90][180] (777600 bytes)
    Float32 /UWND[12][90][180] (777600 bytes)
    Float32 /VWND[12][90][180] (777600 bytes)

You can resolve these issues by requesting less.
 - Consider asking for fewer variables (do you need them all?)
 - If individual variables are too large you can also subset
   them using an index based array subset expression 
   to request a smaller area or to decimate the variable.
