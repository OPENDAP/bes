	Modifications to be able to write all response objects out to
	ostream rather than stdout. Beginnings of chunking. Modified unit
	tests and added new ones to test the funcionality. In PPT making
	sure that handshaking at beginning of connection is done directly to
	socket instead of using send and receive methods on PPTConnection,
	which will be changed to do chunking. The handshaking will NOT do
	chunking but will simply be tokens.

	Replaced unidata with opendap support email.

2007-06-07  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Modified ResponseHandlerList function signature to take a const
	string & instead of a string. This required the same change to all
	ResponseHandler Build methods. Also changed the constructors to take
	a const string & instead of a string. Also changed the constructors
	for the RequestHandler classes to take const string & instead of
	string. Changed the methods in ResponseHandler and RequestHandler
	classes when adding handlers to take const string & instead of
	string.

	Changed all the files to correct a typo in the copyright notice.

2006-11-23  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	All classes in BES now inherit from the same parent, BESObj. BESObj
	has a dump method on it that allows, during debug, for an object's
	state to be dumped (private data members, whatever else). Also on
	the BESObj class is a operator<< method so that you can have an
	object, called obj, and do the following: cout << obj ; Created a
	BESIndent class so that dumps can be indented nicely for easier
	debugging.

	Created a BESDebug class and the beginnings of debug information
	throughout the code. The -d option on the command line client and
	the server (including the besctl script) now work. The options takes
	an argument, either cerr (to dump debug information to cerr) or the
	name of a file where debug information will be sent.

	The -t options on the command line client (and in the PPT client
	code) is now working. Before we accepted the flag, but ignored it.
	In the command line client the usage information is only dumped
	once. And, if version is requested, the usage is NOT dumped after
	the version information is dumped.

	Removed any reference to key/value pairs in the BES configuration
	file that had OPeNDAP at the front and any error messages that
	reference them. They all begin with BES.
