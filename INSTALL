To Build the hdf-dods software:

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
type `sh configure'.

2) Type `make' to build the new library and the three server programs, `make
check' to build the test software. NB: you must have the GNU automated
testing software DejaGNU to run the makefile's check target.

3) Type `make install' to install the new library. 

4) To install the data server you need to copy the four executables (one
script and three binary programs) named `hdf', `hdf_das', `hdf_dds' and
`hdf_dods' to your http server's CGI directory. The executables are located in 
the subdirectory named for you machine type (ie. sun, sgi). For many UNIX computers, 
this will be named cgi-bin and will reside within the http server's home
directory (e.g., on my system the cgi binary directory is called
/usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin). You can find out the name of this directory if
you don't know it by looking in the http server's srm.conf configuration file
(which will be located in a directory called `conf' within the http server's
home directory.
