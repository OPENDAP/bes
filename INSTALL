To Build the hdf-dods software:

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
   type `sh configure'.

2) Type `make' to build the new library and the three server programs, `make
   check' to build the test software. NB: you must have the GNU automated
   testing software DejaGNU to run the makefile's check target.

3) Type `make install' to install the new library. 

4) To install the data server you copy the programs nph-hdf,
   hdf_{das,dds,dods}, usage, deflate, asciival, DODS_Dispatch.pm,
   DODS_Cache.pm, FilterDirHTML.pm and the directories HTML, LWP and MIME
   into one of your WWW server's script alias directories. Data should be
   located within your WWW server's document root directory or be
   (symbolicly) linked to DocumentRoot. You must turn on FollowSymLinks in
   your access.conf file. Use one of the DODS client programs to test your
   installation.

5) The HDF server caches some of its responses to requests. In the past this
   cache was stored in the same directory as the data files being served.
   However, that caused problems with read-only datasets. In the current
   version of the HDF server the cache directory is /usr/tmp and can be
   configured by changing the value of the variable $cache_dir in the file
   nph-hdf.

For information about installing secure DODS servers, see the file SECURITY
in DODS_ROOT.

NOTE FOR LINUX

The linux shell gags on the syntax we use in the Perl scripts to locate the
perl interpreter on your system. Look at the nph-jg script. The top two lines
look like:

    #!/bin/sh -- # -*- perl -*-
    eval "exec perl -T -S $0 $*" if 0;	# Trick to find perl. Must be on PATH.

On Linux you should replace these lines with:

    #!/path/to/your/perl -T

Where /path/to/your/perl is the full pathname of the perl interpreter you
want the servers to use. You can find the path to perl on your computer by
typing:

    which perl

You can check the version of perl by typing:

    perl -v

You need Perl version 5.001 or greater.
