BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

0) Please skim REQUIREMENTS and NOTES sections of this file before reporting
   problems. Thanks.

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
   type `sh configure.' If you want this part of the server to install
   someplace other than /usr/local/bin, use --prefix to change the prefix
   from the default "/use/local/." Make sure that the dap-server CGI knows
   where the handler is located (you can list the complete pathname in the
   dap-server.rc file; see dap-server's INSTALL and README files).

2) Type `make' to build the three server programs

3) Install the server components in $prefix by running `make install.'

4) Type 'make bes-conf' to run the bes-nc-data.sh script which inserts the
   handler in the bes.conf file and adds test data to 
   $prefix/share/hyrax/data.

5) For many installations, you must arrange for your operating system to find
   the shared libraries installed by default in $prefix/lib. Do this by
   either setting an environment variable such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH or by
   editing /etc/ld.so.conf. Different operating systems handle this in
   different ways.

Building from Our SVN Repository

  If you are building from a SVN checkout, run 'autoreconf --verbose' before
  './configure; make'. If you try to run autoconf, et c., by hand and wind up
  with build files that don't work, use 'autoreconf --force --verbose'. Once
  autoreconf has made the configure and Makefile.in files, do ./configure;
  make; make install as outlined above.

REQUIREMENTS

  o You need the libdap library version 3.7.5 to build and install this
    software. If you're using Linux, this means either building form source
    or using the libdap and libdap-devel RPM packages.

  o If you're planning on using this with the OPeNDAP 4 Data Server (Hyrax),
    you'll need version 3.4.1 of the BES software. Make sure to build that 
    first.

  o To use this software with our cgi-based data server, you will need the 
    OPeNDAP dap-server software package, version 3.7.3 (although for this
    release, operation with Server3 has not been tested).

  o You also need a recent copy of HDF4. We've tested this server with
    version 4.2r1, although any recent version should work fine. If the
    configure script cannot find your copy of hdf4, use the
    --with-netcdf options to tell it where to look (see configure --help).
    By default the configure script will look in /usr/local/hdf.

NOTES

  o For information about installing secure OPeNDAP servers, see the file
    SECURITY included with the dap-server software.

  o DEBUGGING AIDS

    - The OPeNDAP libdap library includes the following debugging aids that
      may be of help to you in developing new applications.

    - DBG: simple program instrumentation -- see the file debug.h distributed
      with libdap (which is installed in the libdap header directory; use
      'config-libdap --cflags' and look at the value if -I).

    - DBG2: more elaborate program instrumentation -- by convention this is
      used for output that is half a page or more, while DEBUG is used for
      single line output.

    - To build with program instrumentation use `--enable-debug=<level>'
      where <level> is 1 or 2.

    - By default, both debug and dbnew are *not* enabled. Thus, if you want
      to build a straight version of the libraries and test code, use
      `./configure'. If you want the extra features, use:

      ./configure --enable-dbnew --enable-debug=2
