BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

0) !!! WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING!!! 
   Please read INSTALL_EOS5_GRID instead of this INSTALL
   If you want to VISUALIZE NASA EOS GRID data with OPeNDAP CLIENTS
   like Ferret, IDV, ncBrowse, NCL, GrADS and ODC.
   Continuning the instructions on this INSTALL WILL NOT WORK 
   with the clients mentioned above.

   You've been WARNED and continue to read if you're not going to deal
   with visualization clients.

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
   type `sh configure.' If you want this part of the server to install
   someplace other than /usr/local/bin, use --prefix to change the prefix
   from the default "/use/local/." Make sure that the dap-server CGI knows
   where the handler is located (you can list the complete pathname in the
   dap-server.rc file; see dap-server's INSTALL and README files).

2) Type `make' to build the three server programs

3) Install the server components in $prefix by running `make install'.

4) Type 'make bes-conf' to run the bes-hdf5-data.sh script which inserts the
   handler in the bes.conf file and adds test data to 
   $prefix/share/hyrax/data.

Building from Our SVN Repository

  If you are building from a SVN checkout, run 'autoreconf --verbose' before
  './configure; make'. If you try to run autoconf, etc., by hand and wind up
  with build files that don't work, use 'autoreconf --force --verbose'. Once
  autoreconf has made the configure and Makefile.in files, do ./configure;
  make; make install as outlined above.

REQUIREMENTS

  o You need the libdap library version 3.7.10 to build and install this
    software. If you're using Linux, this means either building form source
    or using the libdap and libdap-devel RPM packages, once they are
    available. 

  o You need a recent(version 1.6.6 or above) copy of HDF5. 
    Use --with-hdf5 to specify where your hdf5 distribution is located 
    if configure cannot find it on its own.
    See './configure --help' for more info.

  o To use this software with our data server, you will need the OPeNDAP
    dap-server software package, version 3.8.4.

  o If you're planning on using this with Hyrax, version 1.3, you'll need
    version 3.5.3 of the BES software.


NOTES

  o SHORT PATH NAME

    - By default, full path names that have group structure information  
      are preserved in the dataset variable names. You can shorten them by 
      using "--enable-short-path=yes" configuration option.
	
  o DEBUGGING AIDS

    - The OPeNDAP libdap library includes the following debugging aids that
      may be of help to you in developing new applications.

    - DBG: simple program instrumentation -- see the file debug.h distributed
      with libdap (which is installed in the libdap header directory; use
      'config-libdap --cflags' and look at the value if -I).

    - DBG2: more elaborate program instrumentation -- by convention this is
      used for output that is half a page or more, while DEBUG is used for
      single line output.

    - To build with program instrumentation use `--enable-debug=<level>'
      where <level> is 1 or 2.

    - By default, both debug and dbnew are *not* enabled. Thus, if you want
      to build a straight version of the libraries and test code, use
      `./configure'. If you want the extra features, use:

      ./configure --enable-dbnew --enable-debug=2

SPECIAL NOTES for NASA EOS DATA

  o EOS	Grid Generation
    - By default, EOS Grid generation is enabled. (See README for details)
      You can turn it off by using "--use_eos_grid=no" configuration option.

  o EOS Metadata Parsing
    - By default, EOS metadata is parsed to display the content of metadata in a structured manner.
      If you want to get the metadata in one big string instead of parsing it for structured output, 
      please use "--use_eos_meta=no" configuration option.
