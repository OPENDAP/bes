<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md72"></a>
Introduction</h1>
<p>The Back-end Server (BES) for Hyrax is a unix daemon that builds DAP2 and DAP4 response for various kinds of data. Since the daemon runs on Unix hosts, it often works with data that are stored in files or collections of files found on file systems. However, the BES can also use data stored in database systems, web object stores (e.g., S3), other kinds of web APIs and remote data accessed using plain HTTP.</p>
<p>In addition to the DAP2/4 protocols, the BES can package responses to queries for data in a number of well-known binary file types, including NetCDF3/4, GeoTIFF and JPEG2000.</p>
<p>All of the functionality specific to DAP or particular types of data is implemented using a group of 'plugin modules.' These modules isolate the operations for specific kinds of daa from the BES software itself. Each kind of data that can be read is accessed using a different module and each response other than the DAP2/4 responses is returned its own module.</p>
<p>The BES does not contain (much) software that implements the DAP2/4 protocols. Instead it uses the libdap4 library for that. See <a href="../../github.com/opendap/libdap4">github.com/opendap/libdap4</a>.</p>
<p>The BES does not implement the WEB API for DAP2/4, instead the OLFS (OPeNDAP Lightweight Front-end Server) is used to do that. See <a href="../../github.com/opendap/olfs">github.com/opendap/olfs</a>.</p>
<p>The BES framework is designed to be extensible and can be used to combine reading various kinds of data with building different kinds of responses. The framework is designed to support lazy data read operations, only reading those data that are needed and only when they are needed. Note that some kinds of well-known binary responses must be built in full before they are returned, but this is not a requirement of the framework but the responses, or their APIs.</p>
<p>Information about the Hyrax data server can be found here in the <a href="https://opendap.github.io/hyrax_guide/Master_Hyrax_Guide.html">latest and most comprehensive Hyrax documentation.</a> <br  />

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md74"></a>
What's here</h1>
<p>Here there's a bes-config script which will be installing in $prefix/bin that can be used to determine where the libraries and their header files have been installed. This directory also contains some documentation files.</p>
<p><em>dispatch</em>: This is where the bulk of the BES source code resides. server: The BES server and standalone executables; build using dispatch cmdln: A command line client which can communicate with the bes server.</p>
<p><em>dap</em>: A module that implements the (OPeN)DAP access.</p>
<p><em>modules</em>: All the modules that are part of a standard Hyrax distribution. The configure script looks for their dependencies and only tries to build the ones that can be built. Note that the HDF4 and 5 modules are pulled in from separate <em>git</em> repositories.</p>
<p><em>xmlcommand</em>: The BES/dispatch software is a framework. The basic commands recognized by it are defined and implemented by software in this directory.</p>
<p><em>standalone</em>: The 'standalone version of the server; used for testing.</p>
<p><em>apache</em>: An Apache module, currently not part of the default build</p>
<p><em>ppt</em>: The PPT implementation. The BES uses PPT for its communication</p>
<p><em>templates</em>: A collection of source files which can be used as templates when you write your own handlers/modules, et cetera.</p>
<p><em>conf</em>: Where the automake and autoconf configuration files live</p>
<p><em>docs</em>: Where some bes documentation resides</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md75"></a>
Configuration</h1>
<p>The BES configuration is controlled by a set of configuration files. While the complete configuration could be held in one file, it is easier to store information specific to each module in a different file. The main configuration file then reads all of the module configuration files, following a common Unix pattern.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md76"></a>
Basic Configuration</h2>
<p>Once the BES software has been installed, you will need to make a few changes to the BES configuration file, which is the bes.conf located in <em>prefix</em><code>/etc/bes/bes.conf</code>. Module and handler configuration files will be installed in the <em>prefix</em><code>/etc/bes/modules</code> directory.</p>
<p>Only a few parameters need to be modified to get the BES up and running for the first time. These parameters are located at the top of the configuration file are are:</p>
<p><b>BES.ServerAdministrator</b></p><ul>
<li>set this to an email address that can be used for users to contact if there are issues with your installation of the server.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>BES.User=user_name</b></p>
<p><b>BES.Group=group_name</b></p><ul>
<li>set these to a valid username and groupname on your system. We recommend that you create a username and groupname called bes that has permissions to write only to the BES installation directory. We'll need to write to the log file, and that's about it.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>BES.LogName=./bes.log</b></p><ul>
<li>Set this to the full path and file name for where you want the BES log file to be written.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this configuration you will be able to start the BES. No handlers or modules have been installed yet, so you won't be able to serve data, but the BES should run.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md77"></a>
Configuration for Hyrax</h2>
<p>For the BES to run with Hyrax, additional changes will need to be made to the dap.conf and dap-server.conf files, which are located in the modules directory <em>prefix</em><code>/etc/bes/modules</code>. The dap module should be installed by default with the BES. If the dap.conf file is not found, be sure that you have libdap installed. The dap-server module, known as the General purpose handlers, adds responses for the DAP ascii response, the DAP info response, and the DAP html form response. You will need to get the dap-server module. You should see a dap-server.conf file in the modules directory.</p>
<p>The changes required for Hyrax are:</p>
<p><b>BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory</b> = <em>path_to_root_data_directory</em></p><ul>
<li>Find the BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory parameter in dap.conf. Set this to the root directory of your data. If you're serving data stored in files, this is the place in the file system where those files are stored.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>BES.Catalog.catalog.Include</b>=;</p><ul>
<li>This parameter specifies what files/directories are included in the list of nodes in the catalog. The default is to show everything. After this parameter is looked at, the Exclude parameter is then looked at to see what files you might want to exclude.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>BES.Catalog.catalog.Exclude=^..*;</b></p><ul>
<li>This parameter specifies what files/directories to include in the list of nodes in the catalog. The default, shown here, is to exclude any files or directories that starts with a dot (.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The only possible configuration parameter that you may need to change is the one that maps a file to a data handler. This parameter is called BES.catalog.TypeMatch, and is found in each of the data handler configuration files, such as nc.conf. The default values should work.</p>
<p>The value of this parameter is a semicolon separated list that matches the name you used in the BES.modules parameter with different datasets. The BES uses regular expressions to identify different types of datasets. In the example given in the file, any dataset name that ends in '.nc' will be accessed using the netcdf hander (because the name 'nc' is used here with the regular expression '.*.nc'; note that the BES uses regular expressions like Unix grep, not file globbing patterns like a command shell). Since the name 'nc' was associated with the netcdf module in the modules section, the netcdf module will be used to access any dataset whose name that ends in '.nc'.</p>
<p>The regular expressions shown in the examples are simple. However, the entire dataset name is used, so it's easy to associate different modules with datasets based on much more than just the 'file name extension' even though that is the most common case.</p>
<p>To test your regular expression for the TypeMatch parameter, or the Include and Exclude parameters, use the supplied besregtest program. Simply run besregtest to discover its usage.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md78"></a>
Installing a custom handler/module</h3>
<p>By default, The BES for Hyrax comes with a suite of handlers that read a number of data formats. However, you can install custom handlers that are not distributed by default. I'll use the SQL handler as an example.</p>
<p>Get the SQL handler source code from <a href="http://github.com/opendap/">http://github.com/opendap/</a>, making sure that the version supports Hyrax. Expand the tar.gz file and follow the instructions with the following caveat: If you have installed the BES using a prefix other than /usr/local (the default), make sure that the correct bes-config is being run. If you are having problems compiling or linking the handler, try using not only &ndash;prefix=... but also &ndash;with-bes=... when you configure the handler.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md79"></a>
Install the newly-built handler.</h4>
<p>Once built, install the handler using 'make install'. This will install the BES module and a configuration file to use for that module. Each module will have its own configuration file. In this case it is nc.conf and installed in the <em>prefix</em><code>/etc/bes/modules</code> directory. The next time the BES is run, this configuration file will be read and the netcdf module loaded. No modifications are necessary.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md80"></a>
Testing</h2>
<p>To test the server, open a new terminal window and start the bes by using the bes control script besctl, which is installed in <em>prefix</em><code>/bin</code>. using the -c switch to name the configuration file. If the server standalone starts correctly it should print something like the following to stdout:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">[jimg@zoe sbin]$ besctl start</div>
<div class="line">BES install directory: &lt;prefix&gt;/bin</div>
<div class="line">Starting the BES daemon</div>
<div class="line">PID: &lt;process_id&gt; UID: &lt;uid of process&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Go back to your first window and run the bescmdln program. Use the -h (host) and -p (port) switches to tell it how to connect to the BES.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">[jimg@zoe bin]$ bescmdln -p 10002 -h localhost</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Type &#39;exit&#39; to exit the command line client and &#39;help&#39; or &#39;?&#39; to display</div>
<div class="line">the help screen</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">BESClient&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Try some simple commands:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">BESClient&gt; show help;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;showHelp&gt;</div>
<div class="line">    &lt;response&gt;</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    ...</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;/response&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;/showHelp&gt;</div>
<div class="line">BESClient&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Note that all commands must end with a semicolon except 'exit'.</p>
<p>Now try to get a DAP response using a handler you registered (the BES supports a fairly complex syntax which I won't explain fully here):</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">BESClient&gt; set container in catalog values n1, data/nc/fnoc1.nc;</div>

<div class="line">BESClient&gt; exit</div>
<div class="line">[jimg@zoe bin]$</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>If you got something similar (you would have used a different dataset name from "data'nc'fnoc1.nc" and thus would get a different DAS response) the BES is configured correctly and is running.</p>
<p>To stop the BES use the bes control script with the stop option:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">[jimg@zoe sbin]$ besctl stop</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Note: Constraints and the bes command line client</p>
<p>Constraints are added to the 'define' command using the modifier 'with' like so:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">define d as nscat with nscat.constraint=&quot;WVC_LAT&quot;;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>If there is a list of containers instead of just one, then there can be a list of &lt;container&gt;.constraint="" clauses.</p>

Various features the BES supports</h1>
<p>Here we highlight some important features of the BES software. This list is far from comprehensive and it is not intended to be a 'new features' list. Most of these features are supported by the BES because they are important to the Hyrax data server. However, all of these are accessible when the BES is used by itself or in conjunction with other software.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md82"></a>
DAP2 versus DAP4</h2>
<p>The code on the master branch now supports both DAP2 and DAP4 responses, and the data format handlers do as well. Because of that, it must be linked with libdap 3.14, not libdap older versions of libdap (libdap 3.14 contains support for both DAP2 and DAP4, while the older 'libdap' supports only DAP2). If you need to get the DAP2-only version of the software, use the branch named 'dap2'. Please commit only fixes there.</p>
<p>Each of the handlers, which can be built as submodules within this code, also has DAP2 and DAP4 support on their master branch and a 'dap2' branch for the DAP2-only code.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md83"></a>
Support for data stored on Amazon's S3 Web Object Store</h2>
<p>Hyrax 1.16 has prototype support for subset-in-place of HDF5 and NetCDF4 data files that are stored on AWS S3. See the preliminary documentation in <a href="https://github.com/OPENDAP/bes/blob/master/modules/dmrpp_module/data/README.md">https://github.com/OPENDAP/bes/blob/master/modules/dmrpp_module/data/README.md</a>.</p>
<p>The new support includes software that can configure data in S3 and on disk so that it can be served (and subset) in-place from S3 without reformatting the original data files. Support for other web object stores besides S3 has also been demonstrated.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md84"></a>
Support for dataset crawler/indexer systems</h2>
<p>We have added support for Datasets served by Hyrax now provide information Google and other search engines need to make these data findable. All dataset landing pages and catalog navigation (contents.html) pages now contain embedded json-ld which crawlers such as Google Dataset Search, NSF's GeoCODES, and other data sensitive web crawlers use for indexing datasets. In order to facilitate this, certain steps can be taken by the server administrator to bring the Hyrax service to Google (and other) crawlers attention. LINK TO JSON-LD README.MD. Our work on JSON-LD support was funded by NSF Grant number 1740704.</p>

Experimental support for STARE indexing</h2>
<p>We have added experimental support for STARE (Spatio Temporal Adaptive-Resolution <a class="el" href="../../d5/dc4/classrapidjson_1_1Encoding.html" title="Concept for encoding of Unicode characters.">Encoding</a>) as part of our work on NASA ACCESS grant 17-ACCESS17-0039.</p>

Server function roi() improvements</h2>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md87"></a>
Site-specific configuration</h2>
<p>The BES uses a number of configuration files, and until now, a site has to customize these for their server. Each server installation would overwrite those files. No more. Now you can put all your configuration values in</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>/etc/bes/site.conf </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And be configent that they will never be overwritten by a new install. The <code>site.conf</code> file is always read last, so parameters set there override values set elsewhere.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md88"></a>
The Metadata Store (MDS)</h2>
<p>A new cache has been added to the BES for Metadata Responses (aka, the MDS or Metadata Store). This cache is unlike the other BES caches in that it is intended to be operated as either a 'cache' or a 'store.' In the latter case, items added will never be removed - it is an open-ended place where metadata response objects will be kept indefinitely. The MDS contents (as a cache or a store) will survive Hyrax restarts.</p>
<p>The MDS was initially built to speed responses when data are stored on high- latency devices like Amazon's S3 storage system. We have special features in Hyrax to handle data kept on those kinds of data stores and the MDS can provide clients with fast access to the metadata for those data very quickly. After our initial tests of the MDS, we decided to make it a general feature of the server, available to data served from data stored on spinning disk in addition to S3.</p>
<p>Note: The MDS is not used for requests that using server-side function processing.</p>
<p>The MDS configuration can be found in the dap.conf configuration file. Here are the default settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the 'path' to null disables uses of the MDS.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>DAP.GlobalMetadataStore.path = @datadir@/mds DAP.GlobalMetadataStore.prefix = mds </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Setting 'size' to zero makes the MDS hold objects forever; setting a positive non-zero size makes the MDS behave like a cache, purging responses when the size is exceeded. The number is the size of the cache volume in megabytes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>DAP.GlobalMetadataStore.size = 200 </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The MDS writes a ledger of additions and removals. By default the ledger is kept in 'mds_ledger.txt' in the directory used to start the BES.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>DAP.GlobalMetadataStore.ledger = @datadir@/mds_ledger.txt </p>
</blockquote>

COVJSON Responses</h2>
<p>For datasets that contain geo-spatial data, we now provide the option to get those data (and related metadata) encoded using the covjson format. (See <a href="https://covjson.org/">https://covjson.org/</a>). Thanks to Corey Hemphill, Riley Rimer, and Lewis McGibbney for this contribution.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md90"></a>
Improved catalog support</h2>
<p>It has long been possible to define 'catalogs' for data that reside on other kinds of data stores (e.g., relational data base systems). The datasets defined by these catalogs appear(ed) in the directory listings as if they are directories of data files, just like datasets that actually are files on a spinning disk.</p>
<p>We have generalized this system so that it is much easier to use. As an example of new Catalog sub-system's ease of use, we have implemented a new module that reads information about datasets from NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR) and uses that to display a Virtual Directory for NASA data, where the hierarchical relationships between data files is derived entirely from data read a CMR-support web API.</p>
<p>This software is currently available in source form only - contact us if you would like to extend the BES Catalog system for your own data collections. To build Hyrax with this feature enabled, build either in developer mode (./configure ... &ndash;enable-developer) or using the spepcial configuration option &ndash;enable-cmr.</p>

For HDF4 data</h2>
<ul>
<li>CF option: Enhance the support of handling the scale_factor and add_offset to follow the CF. The scale_factor and add_offset rule for the MOD16A3 product is different than other MODIS products. We make an exception for this product only to ensure the scale_factor and add_offset follow the CF conventions.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md92"></a>
For HDF5 data</h2>
<p>CF option:</p><ol type="1">
<li>Add the support of the HDF-EOS5 Polar Stereographic(PS) and Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area(LAMAZ) grid projection files. Both projection files can be found in NASA LANCE products.</li>
<li>Add the HDF-EOS5 grid latitude and longitude cache support. This is the same as what we did for the HDF-EOS2 grid.</li>
<li>Add the support for TROP-OMI, new OMI level 2 and OMPS-NPP product.</li>
<li>Removed the internal reserved netCDF-4 attributes for DAP output.</li>
<li>Make the behavior of the drop long string BES key consistent with the current limitation of netCDF Java.</li>
</ol>
