# For the buildSiteMap command, testing is unusual since the command
# returns nothing but writes to the local file system. The baseline
# will be empty unless we're testing an error. Also, because distcheck
# won't allow writing to the source tree, we will not test the default
# behavior where the command writes to the catalog's root. We will 
# always write to some variant of $builddir.
