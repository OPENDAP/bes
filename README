This file describes the HDF5 handler developed by The HDF Group and OPeNDAP, 
Inc. under a grant from NASA. For information about building the HDF5 handler,
 see the INSTALL.


What is HDF5 handler?
---------------------

  Hierarchical Data Format Version 5 (HDF5) is a general-purpose library and 
file format for storing, managing, archiving, and exchanging scientific data. 
The HDF5 data model includes two primary types of objects, a number of 
supporting object types, and metadata describing how HDF5 files and objects 
are to be organized and accessed. The HDF5 file format is self-describing in 
the sense that the structures of HDF5 objects are described within the file.

 The HDF5 handler is a Hyrax Back-end Server(BES) module that maps HDF5 
objects into OPeNDAP's DAP2 data model. This allows users to access the data 
in remote  HDF5 files using the OPeNDAP clients. There can be many ways to 
serve HDF5 data but this handler differentiates itself by putting the goal of 
following CF conventions to support NASA HDF5/HDF-EOS5 products first. The 
HDF5 handler team strives to achieve what is called "CF-compliant" status of 
all NASA HDF5 data products. This means that OPeNDAP visualization client 
users should feel easy in accessing and visualizing the remote NASA 
HDF5/HDF-EOS5 data products if NASA data centers provide the Hyrax OPeNDAP 
services.

 Since some NASA HDF5/HDF-EOS5 products either do not follow or only partially 
follow CF conventions, the handler developers tried to make them be 
CF-compliant  so that OPeNDAP client tools can visualize these products.
This can be realized by the developers' knowledge and experiences as well
as intensive discussions with developers of the corresponding NASA data 
centers. The output of this handler has been checked carefully with OPeNDAP 
client tools such as IDV, Panoply, GrADS, Ferret, NCL, MATLAB, and IDL.

 A comprehensive list of the improvements since the 2.0.0 release is
available on the next section.

What's new for version 2.2.3
----------------------------
For the CF option: 
 -  Implement an option not to pass HDF5 file ID from DDS/DAS service to data service
    since NcML may not work when the file ID is passed.
 -  Add support for several NASA HDF5 products:
    GES DISC GPM level 1, level 2, level 3 DPR, level 3 GPROF, and level 3 IMERGE products
    GES DISC some netCDF-4 like MEaSUREs products
    OBPG level 3m HDF5 and MOPITT level 3 proudcts
 -  Performanc tuning: Add a BES option not to generate StructMetadata for HDF-EOS5-like files. 
 -  Correct the values for the predefined attribute orig_dimname_list.
 -  Read the description of BES keys in the file h5.conf.in to see if the default values need
    to be changed for your service. 


What's new for version 2.2.2
----------------------------
For the CF option: 
 -  Improve file I/O by reducing the number of HDF5 file open/close 
requests. 
 -  Error handling is greatly improved: resources are released properly when 
errors occur.

For both CF and default options:
 - Some memory leaks detected by valgrind are fixed.


What's new for version 2.2.1
----------------------------
  Internal code improvements.

What's new for version 2.2.0
----------------------------
  This version supports dimension scale and ICESat/GLAS product. It also fixes
a few bugs. Please see ChangeLog for details about bug fixes.

What's new for version 2.1.1
----------------------------

  This version fixes a few bugs. It handles the concatenation of metadata files
 in a format like "coremetadata.0" and "coremeata.0.1." In previous versions,
it handled only "coremetadata.x" format. It fixes a bug to access GESDISC 
BUV Ozone files.


What's new for version 2.1.0
----------------------------

  This version improves the performance to read HDF5 variables. The previous 
assumption was that NASA files usually don't have many variables. Thus, to save
 time of opening APIs and better coding for error handling, the handler just 
held the API IDs and released them at last. However, GES DISC recently has 
produced a file with more than 1000 objects and want it to be served by 
OPeNDAP. It took much longer than expected. A thorough investigation 
revealed that the retrieval of HDF5 objects was the performance bottle neck. 
The new version addresses this issue by closing the HDF5 object IDs gradually.

  Also, it fixes a bug that one HDF5 object API is not closed and leaked the
 system resources. 

  A new BES key H5.DisableStructMetaAttr is added so the handler can skip
parsing StructMetadata and generating the attribute in DAS output for HDF-EOS5
 files.
  
What's new for version 2.0.0
----------------------------

  This version has significant changes in handling NASA HDF5/HDF-EOS5 data 
products. As the new major version number change indicates, the CF support  
part of the handler is completely re-engineered.

  Since the main effort of this version of the handler is to support the easy
access of most NASA HDF5/HDF-EOS5 data products by following the CF conventions,
the CF option of the HDF5 handler is turned on by default.

  The --enable-cf configuration option is replaced with the BES key called
"H5.EnableCF". You can enable or disable CF feature of the HDF5 handler 
dynamically by modifying the /etc/bes/modules/h5.conf configuration file
first and then restarting the BES server using "besctl restart".

  The "IgnoreUnknownTypes" BES key is removed because the same functionality is
implemented with the new "EnableCF" key. We added three more keys and they
are explained in the NOTES section of INSTALL file.

  The handler is tested with HDF5 version 1.8.8. We believe that the handler 
should work with HDF5 1.8.5 and versions after. To achieve better performance,
 we strongly suggest users to use the latest HDF5 release. See REQUIREMENTS 
section of INSTALL file on how to get the latest RPMs of HDF5.


Supported NASA HDF5/HDF-EOS5 data products in CF Option in the current release
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        AURA OMI/HIRDLS/MLS/TES
        MEaSUREs SeaWiFS
        MEaSUREs Ozone
        Aquarius
        GOSAT/acos
        SMAP(simulation)

 Please see the Limitation section below for special notes about OMI L2G and 
GOSAT/acos products. We plan to add new NASA HDF5 and HDF-EOS5 products in the 
future release.


Supported HDF5 data types for both CF and default options
---------------------------------------------------------

  NASA data products do not use all HDF5 datatypes provided by the HDF5 
library. Not all HDF5 datatypes can be mapped to DAP2 datatypes, either. 
Thus, the HDF5 handler team focused on the most common HDF5 datatypes. 
Generally, non-supported data types are ignored. 

        unsigned char, char, 
        unsigned 16-bit integer, 16-bit integer,
        unsigned 32-bit integer, 32-bit integer, 
        32-bit and 64-bit floating data, 
        HDF5 string. 
                  

Supported HDF5 data types for the default option only
-----------------------------------------------------

	Compounds: Compound data types are mapped into DAP2 Structure.

	References: Object or regional references are mapped into URLs.

Other mapping information
-------------------------

CF option:

        Group path: An HDF5 dataset's full path information can be found in 
        "fullnamepath" attribute.  

Default option:

        Group path: An HDF5 dataset's full path information can be found in
        in "HDF5_OBJ_FULLPATH" attribute.

       	Group structure: Group structure, the relation among groups, is 
        mapped into a special attribute called "HDF5_ROOT_GROUP".

	Soft/hard Links: Links are mapped to attributes in DAS.

        Comments: Comments are mapped into DAS attributes.


Implementation details in general
----------------------------------

  The implementation largely follows the design. Please read the following
design note for details at

       http://hdfeos.org/software/hdf5_handler/doc/Reengineering-HDF5-OPeNDAP-handler.pdf

  Here are a few highlights for the implementation.

       o The implementation of the CF option is separated from that of the 
       default option.

        o The HDF5 1.8 APIs are used to retrieve HDF5 object information for 
        both the CF and the default options.

        o The CF option only:
           - HDF5 products are categorized and are separately handled except 
             for the modules that can be shared. One such example is the 
             module that makes the object names follow the CF name conventions.
           - Translating metadata to DAP2 is separated from retrieving the 
             raw data.
           - The handler provides an option to handle object name clashing.
           - BES keys are used to replace the #ifdef macro. This makes the 
             code much cleaner and easier to maintain.
           - The DAP2 variable and attribute names strictly follow the object 
             name conventions in the section 3.2.3 of the design note.

Implementation Details for HDF-EOS5 in CF option 
------------------------------------------------

        Swath: Based on the dimension information specified in the 
        StructMetadata file, fake dimension variables are generated with 
        integer values.

        Zonal Average: The current version only supports the zonal average
        file augmented by the HDF-EOS5 augmentation tool since only the 
        augmented zonal average files are found among NASA HDF-EOS5 zonal 
        average products. Dimension variables are constructed based on the 
        augmentation information stored in the file. For more information 
        about the augmentation, please refer to the BACKGROUND section of 
        HDF-EOS5 augmentation tool page at 

              http://hdfeos.org/software/aug_hdfeos5.php


	Grid: The fake dimension handling is the same as Swath. 
        In addition, based on the projection parameters specified in the 
        StructMetadata file, 1-D latitude and longitude arrays are 
        automatically computed and added in the DAP2 output.

	Metadata: If metadata (e.g., StructMetadata or CoreMetadata) is
        split and stored into multiple attributes (e.g., StructMetadata.0,
        StructMetadata.1, ..., StructMetadata.n), they are merged into one
	string and then parsed so that it can be represented in structured 
        attribute format in DAS output. 


Testing the HDF5 handler
------------------------

  The handler source package has more than 50 test files under data/ directory.
If you build the handler from the source, the 'make check' command will test 
both CF and default options using the test HDF5 files. The full C source codes
for generating the test HDF5 files are also available under data/src directory
 although they are not compiled during the building or testing the handler.  


Limitations for the CF option
-----------------------------

        o Generally the mappings of 64-bit integer, time, enum, bitfield, 
        opaque, compound, array, and reference types are not supported. 
        The mapping of one HDF5 64-bit integer variable into two DAP2 32-bit 
        integers in GOSAT/acos is based on the discussions with the data 
        producers. Except one dimensional variable length string array, 
        the mapping of the variable length datatype is not supported either. 
        The handler simply ignores these unsupported datatypes.
        
        o HDF5 files containing cyclic groups are not supported. 
        If such files are encountered, the handler hangs with infinite loops.

        o The handler ignores soft links, external links and comments. 
        A hardlink is handled as an HDF5 object.

        o For the HDF5 datasets created with the scalar dataspace, the handler 
        can only support the string datatypes. It ignores the datasets created
         with other datatypes. HDF5 allows the size of a dimension to be 0 
        (zero) for a dataspace. The handler also ignores the datasets created 
        with such dataspace. The mapping of any HDF5 datasets with NULL 
        dataspace is also ignored.

        o Currently, GOSAT/acos and OMI level 2G products cannot be visualized 
        by OPeNDAP visualization tools because of the limitations of the 
        current CF conventions and netCDF-Java visualization tools (IDV, 
        Panoply, etc.)
        
        o We found object reference attributes in several NASA products. 
        Since these attributes are only used to generate the DAP2 dimensions 
        and coordinate variables, ignoring the mapping of these attributes 
        doesn't lose any essential information for OPeNDAP users.

        o fileout_netcdf prints H5Fclose() internal error message on CentOS6 
        with Hyrax-1.8.8 and hdf5-1.8.5.patch1-7.el6.x86_64.rpm:

        HDF5-DIAG: Error detected in HDF5 (1.8.5-patch1) thread 0:
        #000: ../../src/H5F.c line 1957 in H5Fclose(): invalid file identifier
        major: Invalid arguments to routine
        minor: Inappropriate type

        However, users can still get HDF5 as either NetCDF-3 or NetCDF-4
        successfully. We strongly recommend you to use the latest HDF5 and
        NetCDF RPMs.

Limitations in default option
-----------------------------

	o No support for HDF5 files that have a '.' in a group/dataset
	  name.

	o The mappings of HDF5 64-bit integer, time, enum, bitfield, and 
        opaque datatypes are not supported.

	o Except for one dimensional HDF5 variable length string array, HDF5 
        variable length datatype is not supported either.

        o HDF5 external links are ignored. The mapping of HDF5 objects with 
        NULL dataspace is not supported.


Additional background on the HDF5 handler
-----------------------------------------
  The HDF5 handler is one component of the Hyrax BES; the Hyrax BES
 software is designed to allow any number of handlers to be
configured easily. See the BES Server README and INSTALL files for
information about configuration, including how to use this handler.


Installing the HDF5 handler in Hyrax
------------------------------------

  The Linux RPM package will install h5.conf file with all options true except
 for the H5.EnableCheckNameClashing option. 

  A test HDF5 file is also installed, so after installing this handler, Hyrax
will have a data to serve providing an easy way to test your new
installation and to see how a working handler should look. To use
this, make sure that you first install the BES, and that dap-server
gets installed too. 

  Finally, every time you install or reinstall handlers, make sure to 
restart the BES and OLFS.
