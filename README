This file includes descriptions of HDF5-DODS server prototype(1.1.0).

For information about building the OPeNDAP netCDF Data Handler, see the
INSTALL file.

This data handler includes an executable for use with Server3 and a shared
object module for use with Hyrax. We suggest that Server3 no longer be used.

A configuration edition helper script, `bes-hdf5-data.sh' is provided in this 
package for easy configuration of the Hyrax BES server, designed to edit
bes.conf. The script is called using:

   bes-hdf5-data.sh [<bes.conf file to modify> [<bes modules dir>]]
   
The `bes-conf' make target runs the script while trying to select paths 
cleverly, and should be called using:

   make bes-conf

Test data are also installed, so after installing this handler, Hyrax 
will have data to serve providing an easy way to test your new installation
and to see how a working bes.conf should look. To use this, make sure
that you first install the bes, and that dap-server gets installed too.
Finally, every time you install or reinstall handlers, make sure to restart
the BES and OLFS.

This data handler is one component of the OPeNDAP DAP Server; the server base
software is designed to allow any number of handlers to be configured easily.
See the DAP Server README and INSTALL files for information about
configuration, including how to use this handler.

The original README from Kent Yang (the author of the software) follows and
includes some background on the handler along with some information that's
now out of date:

This server includes three executable programs: h5_das, h5_dds and h5_dods.

1) h5_das: will retrieve hdf5 attributes and put into DODS DAS table.
	Currently this server can retrieve all DODS-supported HDF5 datatype
	including HDF5 String datatype. Note: in the currently
	implementation, DAS table, all hdf5 attribute data will be printed
	out in "text format".

2) h5_dds: will retrieve description of hdf5 dataset(space and datatype)
	information and put it into DODS DDS table. Currently this server
	only supports BASIC HDF5 datatype. No compound datatype is supported.
	Theroetically HDF5 compound datatype can be transformed into DODS
	structure.

3) h5_dods: grab the real data, send it via internet to the client side. This
	server will use DDS table created by h5_dds server. The order,
	correctness and classification of individual dataset are assured by
	reading data using read function in individual subclass inherited
	from base datatype class.

4) Implementation details:

	1. HDF5 Data(including data and metadata structure) Retrieval is 
	implemented at H5Git.c. It cannot solve loop situation of HDF5. 
	Currently it cannot support HDF5 link and object reference retrieval.
	For basic HDF5 dataset, group and attribute information; it can be
	retrieved fairly reasonable.

	2. Both h5_das and h5_dds;h5_dods server use depth-first search to
	walk through HDF5 graph(currently the graph being supported must be a
	tree). The h5_das server retrieves hdf5 attributes and puts them into
	DODS DAS table. DAS table will not hold tree structure gracefully.
	However, by using absolute names of HDF5 object, we may have a good
	view of the structure of the whole HDF5 file. One thing to be noted
	is: the current implementation of h5_das server will make it
	DODS-HDF5 client attribute implementation almost impossible since not
	the real hdf5 attribute data was translated into DODS DAS table but
	all attribute data are represented in a string format. This should be
	aware and may need further investigation.

	3. h5_dds server is really a very limited server; only supporting basic
	datatype of HDF5. No compound datatype of HDF5 is supported. Further 
	investigation need to be done.

	4. No error handling in this prototype yet.

	5. This prototype is not merged into DODS software with autoconf.

Overall, this HDF5-DODS server prototype is not good for genuine users. It is 
basically a guideline for the formal HDF5-DODS server and DODS-HDF5 client.
