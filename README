See the INSTALL file for build instructions.

What's in this direcotry and the subdirectories:

Here there's abes-config script which will be installing in $prefix/bin and
can be used to determine where the libraries and their header files have been
installed. This directory also contains some documentation files.

dispatch: Holds libdispatch and libmodules.

These are the old build instructions; I'm switching to automake support.
9/2/05 jhrg.

Set OPENDAP_ROOT to the parent directory where you installed the daemon
directory. You could specify the different configure options (--prefix for
example), the defaults are set using OPENDAP_ROOT. The location of libdap
also defaults to OPENDAP_ROOT.

So, if you dump the daemon code into /home/pwest/opendap-g (so there is a
directory /home/pwest/opendap-g/daemon) then set OPENDAP_ROOT to
/home/pwest/opendap-g.

Order of building:
    dispatch
    command
    ppt
    cmdln
    server

Building the daemon code:
I'm going to assume that you have NOT set OPENDAP_ROOT. If you did set
OPENDAP_ROOT then you don't need to specify any options for dispatch,
command, ppt or cmdln.

cd dispatch
./configure --with-dap=<dir libdap installed> --prefix=<install-dir>
make
make install

cd ../command
./configure --prefix=<install-dir>
make
make install

cd ../ppt
./configure --prefix=<install-dir>
make
make install

cd ../cmdln
./configure --prefix=<install-dir> --with-readline=<default /usr>
make
make install

cd ../server
Now this is the tough one! You could just do the following:
./configure --prefix=<install-dir> --with-dap=<dir libdap installed>
make
make install

And this would work. You can't serve any data, but you can do things like
'show version;', 'show help;', and even set containers and create
definitions, but there's nothing to serve the data.

I would take a look at runconfig in the server directory to see a few
different examples of how to configure a server. One builds in cedar, another
the esg netcdf, another the fits-handler. There are two different options to
configure:

--with-modules
--with-packages

Again, check out runconfig in the server directory to see some examples.
