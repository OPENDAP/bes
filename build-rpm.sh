# This is part of the Travis build CD process. It is intended to be
# run from within the Travis build process and depends on the settings
# in the BES's .travis.yml file. However, it is run _inside a Docker
# container_ using values passed in by the .travis.yml file
#
# The env vars $HOME, $OS, $DIST, AND $LIBDAP_RPM_VERSION must be set.
#
# run the script like (with the obvious changes for CentOS7):
# docker run -e OS=centos6 -e DIST=el6 -e LIBDAP_RPM_VERSION='3.20.0-1'
# -v $prefix/centos6/rpmbuild:/root/rpmbuild -v `pwd`:/root/travis 
# opendap/centos6_hyrax_builder:1.1 /root/travis/build-rpm.sh 

# e: exit immediately on non-zero exit value from a command
# u: treat unset env vars in substitutions as an error
set -eux

# This script will start with /root as the CWD since that's how the 
# centos6/7 hyrax build containers are configured. The PATH will be 
# set to include $prefix/bin and $prefix/deps/bin; $prefix will be
# $HOME/install. $HOME is /root for the build container.
