This directory should hold the contents of the tar file located here:

http://www.opendap.org/pub/aggregation_performance_test_data/curl_parallel_io_20150903.tgz

(But doesn't because it's a big thing and doesn't belong in GitHub.)

The files (that would be herein) represent the total response time
performance test output of the Hyrax server with the parallel_io 
performance improvementsas as measured through timing curl requests.


These improvements include:
 - The serialize and release memory managment changes.
 - The serialization pipelining changes.
 - The double buffering and mutli threaded serialization scheme aka parallel_io.
