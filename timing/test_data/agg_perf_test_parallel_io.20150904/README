This directory should hold the contents of the tar file located here:

http://www.opendap.org/pub/aggregation_performance_test_data/agg_perf_test_parallel_io.20150904.tgz

(But doesn't because it's a big thing and doesn't belong in GitHub.)

The files (that would be herein) represent the performance test output 
of the Hyrax server with the parallel_io performance improvements.

These improvements include:
 - The serialize and release memory managment changes.
 - The serialization pipelining changes.
 - The double buffering and mutli threaded serialization scheme aka parallel_io.
