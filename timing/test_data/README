This directory contains test data (in the form of some local files and some that 
reference remote tar balls that would need to be retrieved to access the source 
data), along with scripts and and plot formatting files for the Veusz 
application. All of this represents the data colletion and analysis efforts used 
to guide the performance improvements made to the ncml_handler during the summer 
of 2015.
