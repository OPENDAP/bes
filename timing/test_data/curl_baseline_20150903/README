This directory should hold the contents of the tar file located here:

http://www.opendap.org/pub/aggregation_performance_test_data/curl_baseline_20150903.tgz

(But doesn't because it's a big thing and doesn't belong in GitHub.)

The files (that would be herein) represent the baseline total response time
performance test output of the instrumented Hyrax 1.12 server as measured 
through timing curl requests.
